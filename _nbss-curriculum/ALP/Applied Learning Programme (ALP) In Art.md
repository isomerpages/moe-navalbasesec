<p>The NBSS ALP in Art is rooted in the belief of the transformative power of art and its ability to expand students&rsquo; perceptions of the world around them and potential for self-discovery and expression. As students make art, they do more than just create, but also engage in a range of complex reasoning processes, such as comparing, organising, making decisions, investigating, questioning and problem-solving. Through studying and engaging in art, they come to understand that it connects many creative and mainstream industries whose products permeate our everyday lives and contribute to the development of a vibrant Singapore culture. As students make connections between what they learn and what they experience in the real world, they learn to see the relevance of art to their own lives and better appreciate its significance in the social, cultural and economic fabric of contemporary society.</p>
