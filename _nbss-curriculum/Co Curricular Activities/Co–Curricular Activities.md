<p><strong><u>NBSS CCA</u></strong></p>
<p>CCAs are an integral part of our students&rsquo; holistic education. Through CCA, students discover their interests and talents while developing values and competencies that will prepare them for a rapidly changing world. CCA also promotes friendships among students from diverse backgrounds as they learn, play and grow together. Participation in CCA fosters social integration and deepens students&rsquo; sense of belonging, commitment and sense of responsibility to school, community and nation.</p>
<p><strong>CCA Objectives:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Breadth of experiences:</u></strong>Students in each CCA being introduced and exposed to a variety of programmes and activities.</li>
<li><u><strong>Progressive:</strong></u>a comprehensive plan is in place to develop the students progressively in the CCAs.</li>
<li><u><strong>Enjoyment and connection:</strong></u>Students have adequate time during CCA to connect and collaborate with one another, and enjoy the experience.</li>
<li><u><strong>Team Spirit:</strong></u>Students establish good peer relationship and teamwork within the CCA.</li>
<li><u><strong>Competencies development:</strong></u>Students develop character, and citizenship, and achieve the 21st century skills, while identify their interests and talents.</li>
</ul>
