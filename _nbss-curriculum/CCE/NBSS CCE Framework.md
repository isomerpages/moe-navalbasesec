<p>The NBSS Character &amp; Citizenship Education Framework, CALM, supports the school&rsquo;s culture of care and excellence in character development. This framework is developed with a focus on looking into nurturing students who uphold moral principles and caring citizens who value, care and contribute actively to the community and nation. In addition, CALM is also anchored on the building blocks of the Pyramid of Success which show the emphasis on values and attitude for excellence. In essence, CALM prepares our students to be courageous individuals who will take the initiative to take the lead and serve as leaders with humility.</p>
