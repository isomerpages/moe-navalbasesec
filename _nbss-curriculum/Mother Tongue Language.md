<p><strong>VISION: NURTURING ACTIVE LEARNERS AND PROFICIENT USERS</strong></p>
<p>The Mother Tongue department aims to equip Navalites with competency in using&nbsp;Mother Tongue languages as a communication tool and to develop in them an&nbsp;appreciation for the richness of their cultures and history. We believe that&nbsp;learning MTL enables our students to understand and develop their unique identities&nbsp;through a deeper appreciation of culture, traditions, literature and history.</p>
<p><strong>Programmes and Activities</strong></p>
<p>The Mother Tongue department encourages students in the active learning of their Mother Tongue Languages through our programmes. In the various activities, our students develop an appreciation for their unique cultures.</p>
