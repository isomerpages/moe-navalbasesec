<p><strong>Department Vision</strong></p>
<p>The Humanities Department aims to develop, among our students, inquiry-oriented learning dispositions that will allow them to make sense of the complexities of societal issues that they will encounter. We believe every student can and wants to learn and achieve excellence, and actively strive to tap and maximise the potential of every student.<br /></p>
<p><strong>Teaching and Learning Approaches</strong></p>
<p>Our key teaching and learning approach is adopted in line with the aim to help students become inquiry-oriented learners. As such the department adopts an inquiry-based approach towards teaching and learning to enable students to reach for deeper and enduring understanding of concepts through their own discovery and reasoning. This is in line with Ministry of Education&rsquo;s advocated approach towards the teaching of Humanities in Singapore.</p>
