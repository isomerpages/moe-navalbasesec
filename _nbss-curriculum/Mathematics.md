<p><strong>The Department</strong></p>
<p>The Mathematics department aims to provide a nurturing and diversified experience for students pursuing mathematics that focuses on mathematical problem solving. Mathematics problem solving is central to mathematics learning as it involves the acquisition and application of mathematics concepts and skills in a wide range of situations, including non-routine, open-ended and real-world situations. The development of mathematical problem solving ability is dependent on five inter-related components, namely Concepts, Skills, Processes, Attitudes and Metacognition.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Mathematics Curriculum Overview</strong></p>
<p>Mathematics is a spiral curriculum that focuses on three strands namely Numbers and Algebra, Geometry and Measurement and Statistics and Probability.</p>

<p>The syllabus aims to equip students with mathematical concepts and skills for continuous learning in Mathematics and to support learning in other subjects. Skills taught include to</p>
<p>- Develop thinking, reasoning, communication, application and metacognitive skills through a mathematical approach to problem-solving</p>
<p>- Connect ideas within mathematics and between mathematics and other subjects through applications of mathematics, and</p>
<p>- Build confidence and foster interest in Mathematics&nbsp;</p>
<p>The department uses a range of techniques for our learners. In tandem to the use of questioning techniques based on Bloom&rsquo;s Taxanomy, Polya&rsquo;s Four Steps Approach is used by teachers to model the steps. This approach helps students to scaffold their strategies in problem solving.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In lower secondary, building foundation is the key focus. To help students shift from using the model approach, teachers adopt the Concrete&rarr;Pictorial&rarr;Abstract (CPA) approach in class. In addition, the ICAN (Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy) approach is used to help our low progress learners acquire concepts in a scaffolded and structured way. ICAN strategies includes ways to close&nbsp;issues of learning gaps, language, motivation and memory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Teachers also uses different modes to assess students learning in the class through the use of technology. Students have the opportunities to use technology for self-assessment as well as collaborative work.</p>
