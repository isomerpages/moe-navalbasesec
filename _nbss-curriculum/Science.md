<p><strong>Department Vision<br /></strong>Guided by the principle that every child can learn and excel, and its vision - Inquiring Mind and Innovative Spirit - the Science Department constantly seeks to improve on the quality of interaction between the teacher and the learner, to bring out the best in our students. Based on the unique needs, aspirations and abilities of our students, differentiated programmes are designed and conducted to excite our students and help them to develop not just scientific knowledge and skills, but also acquire lifeskills and the values, attitudes and mindsets that will serve them well in life.</p>

<p><strong>Curriculum, Pedagogy and Assessment</strong></p>
<p>Our Science curriculum framework was derived from Ministry of Education&rsquo;s Policy Framework for the teaching and learning of Science which seeks to inculcate and nurture the spirit of inquiry and curiosity. This framework guides us in designing and crafting our lesson packages and enrichment program to provide an authentic learning experience for our students as well as develop the desired thinking dispositions in them and during the process bring about Joy of Learning for Science.</p>
<p>Our Science programme takes into consideration the different learning experiences for our students. Teachers are guided by the core ideas and essential question when they plan and deliver their lessons. We adopt the 5E Instructional Model to plan an inquiry-oriented student-centric lesson. Teachers are equipped with a repertoire of teaching strategies to cater to the different learning profile of the students. Examples of the teaching pedagogies used include teacher-directed learning, Socratic questioning, Making Thinking Visible routines, collaborative learning, flipped classroom, peer teaching, oral presentation, Cornell note-taking, mind mapping and the use of games for learning.</p>
<p>Our department also believes in using varied mode of assessments, ranging from oral presentations to projects to practical and written papers, to provide a holistic assessment of our students. Formative assessment in the form of quizzes and model making are also used to provide information of the extent of learning, understanding of concepts and mastery of skills.</p>
