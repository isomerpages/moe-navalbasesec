<p><strong>Department Vision<br /></strong>Guided by the principle that every child can learn and excel, and its vision - Inquiring Mind and Innovative Spirit - the Science Department constantly seeks to improve on the quality of interaction between the teacher and the learner, to bring out the best in our students. Based on the unique needs, aspirations and abilities of our students, differentiated programmes are designed and conducted to excite our students and help them to develop not just scientific knowledge and skills, but also acquire lifeskills and the values, attitudes and mindsets that will serve them well in life.</p>
