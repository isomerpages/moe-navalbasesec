<p><strong><u>Central Idea for LLP - Sports</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Character Education through Sports Awareness, Commitment and Empowerment (SPACE)</li>
<li>In Naval Base Secondary School, we define success as</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>"Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you </em></strong><strong><em>made the effort to do your best to become the best that you are capable of becoming."</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The framework with which we base our approach is the Pyramid of Success. This is a self evolution&nbsp;tool with which we teach our students the various blocks to success.</li>
</ul>
