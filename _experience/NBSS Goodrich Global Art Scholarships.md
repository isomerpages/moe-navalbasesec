<p>The NBSS-GG Art Scholarships have now ceased. On behalf of the student recipients and the school, we would like to thank Mr Chan Chong Beng for his significant contributions through the NBSS-GG Scholarship. Between 2009 and 2015, he has sponsored over $43,000 worth of scholarship funding, helping 59 students achieve their aspirations in Art.</p>
<p>From 2016, the school will offer the NBSS-Crete Arts and Sports Scholarships, details to be updated soon.&nbsp;</p>
