<h4><strong>School Counselling Service</strong></h4>
<p>A positive and balanced state of mind is an important pre-condition for doing well in school (academic as well as co-curricular pursuits).</p>
<p>Students who need to seek advice or speak to someone over any personal or school issue that bothers him/her can make an appointment with our school counsellor who provides the psycho-socio-emotional support for any student. Some issues could be</p>
<ul>
<li>strained inter-personal relationships</li>
<li>poor self discipline</li>
<li>bullying</li>
<li>study and examination-related stress</li>
<li>substance abuse</li>
<li>sexual / physical / emotional abuse</li>
</ul>
<p>Students can also approach the school counsellor to find out more about educational options and explore future careers. Do visit the ECG corner at the Library or access the&nbsp;<a href="https://ecareers.sg/G_Login_SG/ecareersLogin.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ecareers portal</a>&nbsp;for more information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To see the counsellor, students may walk in during recess or after school.</p>
<p>School Counsellor: Ms Lucy Png, Venue: Hope Sanctuary (Level 2, next to Staff Room)&nbsp;</p>
