<p>Home-Based Learning (HBL) has always been an integral component of the
MOE’s Curriculum Continuity Plan (CCP), and is part of the whole-school
Emergency Plan for unscheduled school closure. The CCP aims to ensure continuity
of learning, by minimising loss of curriculum time whilst keeping students
meaningfully occupied at home. The Student Learning Space (SLS) will be
the main platform for asynchronous learning during HBL. Teachers may choose
to use a variety of tools and various platforms to enhance learning for
Navalites during HBL.&nbsp;</p>
