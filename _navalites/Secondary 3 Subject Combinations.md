### Making Wise Subject Choices

Choosing the best subject combination at Secondary 3, with the deliberations happening throughout the later half of Secondary 2, is the first step in the secondary school's Education &amp; Career Guidance (ECG) journey. 

In working closely with our Navalites to make the best-informed decision for their Secondary 3 Subject Combination, we honour our Navalitesâ€™ choice of subjects, based on their academic inclinations and strengths, as well as their aspirations, interests and aptitudes.

#### Allocation of Subjects
The subject combinations offered to students will be based on their overall academic performance, availability of school resources and vacancies in each option.
