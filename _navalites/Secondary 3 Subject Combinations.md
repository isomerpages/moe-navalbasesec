<h3>Making Wise Subject Choices</h3>
<p>Choosing the best subject combination at Secondary 3, with the deliberations
happening throughout the later half of Secondary 2, is the first step in
the secondary school's Education &amp; Career Guidance (ECG) journey.</p>
<p>In working closely with our Navalites to make the best-informed decision
for their Secondary 3 Subject Combination, we honour our Navalites’ choice
of subjects, based on their academic inclinations and strengths, as well
as their aspirations, interests and aptitudes.</p>
