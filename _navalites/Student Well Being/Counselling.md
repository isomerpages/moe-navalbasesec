<h4><strong>School Counselling Service</strong></h4>
<p>A positive and balanced state of mind is an important pre-condition for
doing well in school (academic as well as co-curricular pursuits).</p>
<p>Students who need to seek advice or speak to someone over any personal
or school issue that bothers him/her can make an appointment with our school
counsellor who provides the psycho-socio-emotional support for any student.
Some issues could be</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>strained inter-personal relationships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>poor self discipline</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bullying</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>study and examination-related stress</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>substance abuse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sexual / physical / emotional abuse</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Students can also approach the school counsellor to find out more about
educational options and explore future careers. Do visit the ECG corner
at the Library.</p>
<p>To see the counsellor, students may walk in during recess or after school.</p>
