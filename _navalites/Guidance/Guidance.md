<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Naval Base Secondary School is a caring school. Our Navalites are warm, lovable and highly teachable. Here, we believe in building a culture of Care and Excellence, which is a critical ingredient for success for our students. Our Guidance model goes beyond ensuring behavioural compliance in students according to school rules and regulations to one that empowers our students to make good decisions based on sound values and principles.</p>
<p>We believe that order and discipline are necessary for Navalites to learn well and pledge to create a conducive environment that is caring, encouraging and supports them in learning and growing from their mistakes. This positive and proactive approach create a safe space for students both physically and psychologically. We are grounded and motivated by our goal to instill self-discipline and good character in Navalites. This includes equipping them with the necessary social and emotional skills, hence promoting positive student behaviour in support of their learning and growth. To achieve this, we explicitly teach values and skills, and address students’ misbehaviour through timely reinforcement and guidance. Navalites need to understand the importance of thinking before acting, and they must learn to take responsibility for their actions. NBSS adopts the Restorative Practice framework that aims to strengthen relationships between individuals as well as social connections within the school community. This approach is paired with corrective counselling by the teachers, Year Heads, School Counsellors and Guidance Coordinators to reinforce students’ understanding of their actions and the consequences, and commit to not repeating their mistakes. This is a suitable approach that has worked well over the years as it was observed that Navalites have a more positive reaction to approaches that are fair yet firm. They also accept disciplinary measures that are logical, appropriate, and preserve their dignity.</p>
