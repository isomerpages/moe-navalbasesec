<p>At Naval Base Secondary School (NBSS), people matter most. Every Navalite’s
growth, friendships, and the way everyone treats one another are at the
heart of who we are. Our school takes pride in being a caring and supportive
place where all belong.
<br>
<br>At NBSS, the aim is to build a culture of Care and Excellence together.
This means looking out for one another, striving for our best, and holding
ourselves to the right standards. Students are guided to make responsible
choices and manage themselves well — qualities that will not only make
a difference in school life, but also shape strong and confident individuals
for the future.</p>

<p><strong><u>Anti-Bullying Policy</u></strong> 
<br>Naval Base Secondary adopts a zero-tolerance stance towards bullying.
We believe in nurturing a school environment where every member feels safe,
respected and valued. No one should be bullied, and no one should engage
in bullying behaviour.
<br>
<br><strong><u>What is Bullying?</u></strong>
<br>Bullying is defined as deliberate and repeated behaviour which is intended
to hurt someone either physically, emotionally or psychologically.&nbsp;When
incidents of bullying occur, they should be brought to the attention of
the authorities immediately through <u>any</u> school staff.&nbsp; All reports
will be taken seriously and treated confidentially.</p>
