<p><strong>Anti-bullying Policy</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naval Base Secondary adopts a zero-tolerance stance towards bullying.
We believe in nurturing a school environment where every member feels safe,
respected and valued. No one should be bullied, and no one should engage
in bullying behaviour.</p>

<p><strong>What is BULLYING?</strong>
</p>
<p>Bullying is defined as deliberate and repeated behaviour which is intended
to hurt someone either physically, emotionally or psychologically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When incidents of bullying occur, they should be brought to the attention
of the authorities immediately through <u>any</u> school staff.&nbsp; All
reports will be taken seriously and treated confidentially.</p>
