<p><strong>School Counselling Services</strong>
</p>
<p>A positive and balanced state of mind is an important pre-condition for
doing well in school (academic as well as co-curricular pursuits).</p>
<p>Students who need to seek advice or speak to someone over any personal
or school issue that bothers him/her can make an appointment with our school
counsellor who provides the psycho-socio-emotional support for any student.
Some issues could be:</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strained interpersonal relationships</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; poor self discipline</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bullying</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; study and examination-related stress</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; substance abuse</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sexual / physical / emotional abuse</p>
<p>To see the counsellor, students may walk in during recess or after school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>School Counsellors: Ms Lucy Png and Mr Li Jun Yang</p>
