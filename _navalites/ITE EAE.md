<p><strong>Institute of Technical Education (ITE) â€“ Early Admission Exercise (EAE)</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ITE EAE provides a pathway for graduating N-Level and O-Level students to apply for and receive conditional offers for admission to ITE. Beyond academic grades, EAE applicants are considered on the basis of demonstrated aptitude and interest towards a specific course. It is strongly recommended for students who are clear about what they want to pursue in our Post-Secondary Educational Institutes (PSEIs).</p>
