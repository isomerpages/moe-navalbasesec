<p>"<strong><em>With Pride We Play</em></strong>". There is a reason why our band chose this as our motto &ndash; we constantly strive to play to the best of our ability. At Naval Base Secondary School, we never fail to put in our best effort and go all out during rehearsals and performances, to display our musical skills and perform with confidence.&nbsp;In order to achieve competitive greatness, it is imperative for us to possess tight-knit teamwork and hence, success, especially in a CCA with as many sections and people as ours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our band, we are like family. Although we may disagree and debate over some issues, we will always iron things out amicably and support each other. We have met many obstacles in our journey thus far, and it was through sheer teamwork, intentness, and adaptability that we managed to overcome it together. We have learnt that it is important to have an open, growth mindset whenever we meet with challenges in order to succeed and move on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In school, we perform during the Chinese New Year concert, SHINE, National Day celebration and Achievement Day. We have also received invitations to perform in the public. In the recent SYF, we have clinched the Certificate of Accomplishment.</p>
