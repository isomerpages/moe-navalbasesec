<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Library Club aims to instil in the members a love for books as well as equip them with skills necessary to promote reading among their peers in the school. Through the various activities within the CCA, the members will develop their leadership abilities and strengthen their communication skills.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The CCA has organised various activities&nbsp;related to reading and book promotion. Members learn the art of story-telling and have participated in the Queen&rsquo;s Commonwealth Essay Competition. They learn to shelf as well as select appropriate books for Book Buffet - where students visit the library to taste a selection of books to browse and borrow. Furthermore, they create short videos using their personal learning devices (PLDs) where they have to put to use their interview and presentation skills.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the library related activities, the members work on community projects to broaden their perspectives and learn the importance of social cohesion. They interviewed and filmed the school&rsquo;s service providers like the security personnel, canteen vendors and contract cleaners to understand their work and contribution to the school. They also participated in a video competition held by Lions Home for the Elders. Through these activities, they learn how to empathise with the less privileged people.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Library&nbsp;Club continues to work in its vision to instil a love for lifelong passion for reading&nbsp;among the&nbsp;NBSS students.</p>

<p><u>Upcycling Workshop</u></p>
<p>Our students attended Upcycling Workshop by Terra SG in February and applied what they learnt from the workshop through a Mini Upcycling Competition. Each group came up with an upcycling product and voted for the best upcycling product.</p>
