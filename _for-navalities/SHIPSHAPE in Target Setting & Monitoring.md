<p><u><strong>SHIPSHAPE in Target Setting &amp; Monitoring</strong></u></p>
<p>Self-mastery is the process of working on never-ending continuous improvement, targeted towards overcoming fears and breaking through resistance one faces. This is achieved through developing strong belief in self and putting in effort to develop one&rsquo;s personal mastery, which includes addressing one&rsquo;s shortcomings to close the gap between current reality and personal vision.</p>
<p>Rationale:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take personal responsibility for his/her learning through constant reflection and&nbsp;in the process, stretch his/her learning,</li>
<li>Identify one's gaps and close them through a comprehensive plan, and</li>
<li>Work towards being at his/her best</li>
</ul>
<p>The Development Plan for Self-Mastery promotes reflection and a proactive attitude towards one&rsquo;s growth and development. It is anchored on developing a growth mindset; one should focus on the inner locus of control to take charge of situations and succeed. It encourages one to ask the five Self-Mastery questions:</p>
<p>&bull; What is my personal vision?<br />&bull; What is my current reality?<br />&bull; What I need to do to close the gap between my vision and the current reality?<br />&bull; When am I going to implement my plan?<br />&bull; How am I going to monitor and make adjustments to my plans to achieve my vision?</p>
