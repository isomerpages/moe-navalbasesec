<p>The NBSS Pyramid of Success (PoS) is adopted from John Wooden&rsquo;s theory of success and is an anchor to promoting character and achieving success in NBSS. It is also aligned to Thomas Lickona&rsquo;s Performance &amp; Moral Character traits which allow Navalites to develop holistically during their years in NBSS.<strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Why NBSS PoS<br /></strong>The PoS allows NBSS to</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish a common understanding of what success is and how to go about achieving success,&nbsp;</li>
<li>Develop both performance and moral character traits,&nbsp;</li>
<li>Acquire the right values and attitudes, where the battle is towards self and not against others to achieve and excel.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>"Success is a peace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best of which you are capable."</em></p>
<p><strong>The NBSS PoS comprises the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>5 Stout Hearts Blocks</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The two key cornerstones to the PoS are &lsquo;Industriousness&rsquo; and &lsquo;Enthusiasm&rsquo;. These are the two most important blocks in the PoS, without which, the whole PoS would fail. The other three key foundations to the PoS are the qualities of &lsquo;Friendship&rsquo;, &lsquo;Loyalty&rsquo; and &lsquo;Cooperation&rsquo;. These five building blocks are the foundations of the PoS. These are the blocks which reach out to the heart. These are the 5 Stout Hearts blocks.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>4 Great Thoughts Blocks</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The next four building blocks reach out to the thoughts and minds of the people. These are the qualities of &lsquo;Self-control&rsquo;, &lsquo;Alertness&rsquo;, &lsquo;Initiative&rsquo; and &lsquo;Intentness&rsquo;. They are the 4 Great Thought Blocks.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>3 Brave Deeds Blocks</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The three building blocks of &lsquo;Condition&rsquo;, &lsquo;Skill&rsquo; and &lsquo;Team Spirit&rsquo; are meant to guide one in his/her action. These are the 3 Brave Deeds Blocks. At the heart of the PoS is &lsquo;Skill&rsquo; as this is the actual skill/content being learnt. The rest of the building blocks assist in levelling up this skill and making the person a better learner and person.</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;<strong>2 Mortars of the PoS</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The two mortars of the PoS are the attributes of &lsquo;Faith&rsquo; and &lsquo;Patience&rsquo;. These are attributes which run across the PoS and are requirements throughout for one to develop and grow in the various building blocks.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Pinnacle: Be Our Best</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When someone achieves the above three levels of Stout Hearts, Great Thoughts and Brave Deeds he/she acquires the necessary characteristics for success. This allows him/her to gain the next two blocks of &lsquo;Poise&rsquo; and &lsquo;Confidence&rsquo;, which in turn allows him/her to achieve &lsquo;Competitive Greatness&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Competitive Greatness then is not meant to compete against the abilities and talents of an opponent, but to work towards being at one&rsquo;s best and maximising the strengths of oneself.&nbsp;</p>
