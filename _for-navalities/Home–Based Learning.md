<p>Home-Based Learning (HBL) has always been an integral component of the MOE&rsquo;s Curriculum Continuity Plan (CCP), and is part of the whole-school Emergency Plan for unscheduled school closure. The CCP aims to ensure continuity of learning, by minimising loss of curriculum time whilst keeping students meaningfully occupied at home. The Student Learning Space (SLS) will be the main platform for asynchronous learning during HBL. Teachers may choose to use a variety of tools and various platforms to enhance learning for Navalites during HBL.&nbsp;<br /><br />For more information, please refer to the following:<br /><a href="/files/Resource%20Kit%20-%20HBL.pdf">Resource Kit - HBL.pdf</a><br /><a href="https://navalbasesec.moe.edu.sg/qql/slot/u510/other/announcement/SLS%20Instructions%20and%20FAQs%20for%20students.pdf">SLS Instructions and FAQs for students.pdf</a></p>
