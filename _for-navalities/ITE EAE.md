<p><strong>Institute of Technical Education (ITE) &ndash; Early Admission Exercise (EAE)</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ITE EAE provides a pathway for graduating N-Level and O-Level students to apply for and receive conditional offers for admission to ITE. Beyond academic grades, EAE applicants are considered on the basis of demonstrated aptitude and interest towards a specific course. It is strongly recommended for students who are clear about what they want to pursue in our Post-Secondary Educational Institutes (PSEIs).</p>
<p><strong>EAE Timeline (Update for 2022)</strong></p>
<p>The ITE EAE for N-Level and O-Level students, for admission to ITE in Academic Year 2023, will commence on&nbsp;<strong>26 May 2022 to 1 Jun 2022</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are some important dates to note:</p>

<p>To ensure the safety and well-being of students and staff amidst the COVID-19 situation,&nbsp;ITE will conduct EAE selections largely via electronic means, such as online interviews, or portfolio submissions over email, for most courses. On-campus selection will still need to proceed for some courses, where the selection process cannot be meaningfully replicated in a remote manner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recognize that the shift to remote selection will affect many students, and that students will require more support to adapt to this mode of selection. We have planned talks and workshops to prepare our students.&nbsp;</p>
