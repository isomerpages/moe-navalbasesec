<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>OUR CAMPUS</strong></p>
<img src="/images/camp1.jpg">
<p style="text-align: center;">NBSS aims to be a caring school to live, work and play in, where the human character flourishes. The twin concepts of &lsquo;School as a Giant Art Gallery&rsquo; and &lsquo;School in a Garden&rsquo; contribute to the overarching concept of the &lsquo;School as a Big Learning Space&rsquo;, which fulfils this vision, so that the school remains a welcoming and safe home for both staff and students, as well as an inviting space for partners and visitors for collaboration and learning.</p>
