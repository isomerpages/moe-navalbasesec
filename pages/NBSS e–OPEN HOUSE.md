<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>OUR CAMPUS</strong></p>
<img src="/images/camp1.jpg">
<p style="text-align: center;">NBSS aims to be a caring school to live, work and play in, where the human character flourishes. The twin concepts of &lsquo;School as a Giant Art Gallery&rsquo; and &lsquo;School in a Garden&rsquo; contribute to the overarching concept of the &lsquo;School as a Big Learning Space&rsquo;, which fulfils this vision, so that the school remains a welcoming and safe home for both staff and students, as well as an inviting space for partners and visitors for collaboration and learning.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>OUR HERITAGE</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The history of Naval Base Secondary School (NBSS) began in 1957 when the British Navy set aside a piece of land in the British Naval Base at Bah Tan Road to build a school for the children of its employees. The school was then known as Naval Base School and a full school. The first Principal to take the helm was the late Mr Wong Quek Boon. At that time, it was the only full, government, English-medium school in Singapore, with both primary and secondary sections.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">In 1965, NBSS produced Singapore&rsquo;s top O-level student, Dr Tan Boon Wan. Other luminary alumni include prominent lawyer, the late Subhas Anandan, and national footballers, Quah Kim Song and Quah Kim Swee. In 1968, the primary section was transferred to Canberra School. The school has occupied its current campus since December 2009.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>TEACHING &amp; LEARNING IN NBSS</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">At NBSS, we believe that every student can learn and recognise the importance of nurturing our students to take ownership of their learning. Through their learning, the school aims to develop Navalites to become Authentic Learners, Critical Thinkers, Engaged Learners and Self-directed Learners (ACES).&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">NBSS is committed to instilling the Joy of Learning in our students, and the learning experiences that the students go through are designed to optimise their engagement and motivation levels. Learning is enhanced through the meaningful use of info-communications technology, as well as a variety of activities that excite and engage students, such as learning journeys, competitions, showcases and much more. Assessment modes are periodically reviewed and calibrated to ensure that they continue to both give students a sense of success and challenge them to greater heights.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT IN NBSS</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Naval Base Secondary School&rsquo;s vision of &lsquo;Leaders of Character, School of Excellence&rsquo; stems from its belief that character development is key to the holistic development of its students, and an important pathway towards excellence and nurturing the ethical self. As such, character development is a school-wide effort, and a pervasive feature of students&lsquo; learning in the school. Anchored on the school&rsquo;s values of ExC2ITe (Excellence, Care, Courage, Integrity and Teamwork), the school&rsquo;s character development programme aims to develop character and cultivate leadership among our students through three key enablers: Citizenship &amp; Character Education, Guidance Programme and Student Leadership Programme.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>OUR ALP &amp; LLP</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The&nbsp;<strong>NBSS ALP in Art</strong>&nbsp;is rooted in the belief of the transformative power of art and its ability to expand students&rsquo; perceptions of the world around them and potential for self-discovery and expression. Through studying and engaging in art, they learn to see the relevance of art to their own lives and better appreciate its significance in the social, cultural and economic fabric of contemporary society.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The school&rsquo;s ALP in Art provides art learning to all students throughout their 4 to 5 years in the school. Students are exposed to a wide range of art and design practices from four broad art disciplines, namely fine art, digital media, design and the critical study of art. The ALP in Art curriculum is delivered through the formal art curriculum and co-curriculum, which comprises the Art Club CCA and enrichment and talent development programmes. Through their art learning, students become Ardent Advocates, Confident Communicators, Empowered Thinkers and Skilled Practitioners (ACES) of art.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The&nbsp;<strong>NBSS LLP of Character Education through Sports</strong>&nbsp;is anchored on the belief that sports provide an authentic platform for the development of character. The LLP promotes active living where students enjoy and engage in movement activities and develop a solid foundation for a balanced and healthy lifestyle. Together with the ALP in Art, it is evident of the school&rsquo;s commitment to the holistic development of our students.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The LLP is anchored on the NBSS SHIP-SHAPE self-development tool, and seeks to instill moral and performance character in our students through their engagement in sports. These are universal traits that are relevant beyond the sporting arena, providing a strong foundation for personal mastery and excellence in all their pursuits.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>CO-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES</strong>&nbsp;</p>

This helps the individual to lead a balanced life in adulthood. All CCAs emphasise social interaction but each CCA has its specific objectives.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>TALENT DEVELOPMENT IN NBSS</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The NBSS Scholars Programme is an exclusive programme designed to provide an enriched and challenging learning experience for students with talents in specific areas of learning. It provides selected students with the edge to succeed in their areas of talent through specially-crafted programmes designed to challenge them while deepening their passion and interest in their talent areas. Secondary 1 students are invited to join one of the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><u>Research Scholars Programme (RSP)</u></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The RSP is offered to students who show keen interest in and predisposition towards numeracy, scientific inquiry and problem-solving. Scholars will also get to develop creative academic games and organise competitions in the areas of Mathematics and Science. In addition, they will be involved in research projects with higher institutions and attachment programmes with industrial partners.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><u>English Language Scholars Programme (ELSP)</u></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The ELSP focuses on the finer aspects of communication and is offered to students with a flair for the English Language. Besides gaining additional exposure at public speaking competitions, scholars will also be required to produce several pieces of written work at a standard worthy of publication.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><u>Art Talent Development Programme (ATDP)</u></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The ATDP is a 4- to 5-year CCA-based programme for students with a keen interest and talent in art. Aside from developing their personal practice and portfolio, students on the ATDP will also participate in key developmental programmes at different stages of their learning. For example, Secondary 2 ATDP students will participate in a 6-week Learn to Curate Programme co-developed with the National Gallery Singapore. The students then apply their learning from the programme by curating the school&rsquo;s annual art exhibition.</p>
