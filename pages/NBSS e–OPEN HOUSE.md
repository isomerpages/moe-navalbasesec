<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>OUR CAMPUS</strong></p>
<img src="/images/camp1.jpg">
<p style="text-align: center;">NBSS aims to be a caring school to live, work and play in, where the human character flourishes. The twin concepts of &lsquo;School as a Giant Art Gallery&rsquo; and &lsquo;School in a Garden&rsquo; contribute to the overarching concept of the &lsquo;School as a Big Learning Space&rsquo;, which fulfils this vision, so that the school remains a welcoming and safe home for both staff and students, as well as an inviting space for partners and visitors for collaboration and learning.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>OUR HERITAGE</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The history of Naval Base Secondary School (NBSS) began in 1957 when the British Navy set aside a piece of land in the British Naval Base at Bah Tan Road to build a school for the children of its employees. The school was then known as Naval Base School and a full school. The first Principal to take the helm was the late Mr Wong Quek Boon. At that time, it was the only full, government, English-medium school in Singapore, with both primary and secondary sections.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">In 1965, NBSS produced Singapore&rsquo;s top O-level student, Dr Tan Boon Wan. Other luminary alumni include prominent lawyer, the late Subhas Anandan, and national footballers, Quah Kim Song and Quah Kim Swee. In 1968, the primary section was transferred to Canberra School. The school has occupied its current campus since December 2009.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>TEACHING &amp; LEARNING IN NBSS</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">At NBSS, we believe that every student can learn and recognise the importance of nurturing our students to take ownership of their learning. Through their learning, the school aims to develop Navalites to become Authentic Learners, Critical Thinkers, Engaged Learners and Self-directed Learners (ACES).&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">NBSS is committed to instilling the Joy of Learning in our students, and the learning experiences that the students go through are designed to optimise their engagement and motivation levels. Learning is enhanced through the meaningful use of info-communications technology, as well as a variety of activities that excite and engage students, such as learning journeys, competitions, showcases and much more. Assessment modes are periodically reviewed and calibrated to ensure that they continue to both give students a sense of success and challenge them to greater heights.</p>
