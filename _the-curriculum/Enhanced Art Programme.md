<p>The Enhanced Art Programme (EAP) is a Ministry of Education initiative introduced in 2011 to provide greater opportunities for students with keen disposition and capability in art to develop their talent. It is a two-year programme that provides an enriched learning environment for Secondary 3 and 4 students who are inclined towards art. From 2017, a total of nine schools in Singapore will offer the programme.</p>
<p>The EAP is offered to all upper secondary art students and delivered during curriculum time. Aside from the enhanced learning opportunities that stretch students&rsquo; talents and groom them for artistic excellence, students will also get to enjoy state-of-the-art facilities to support their art learning and growth. In line with this, the school has recently refurbished its two art studios, the outdoor learning space and the school&rsquo;s in-house art gallery to better support its EAP and larger ALP.&nbsp;</p>
