**MOTHER TONGUE FORTNIGHT**

The annual Mother Tongue Language Fortnight Programme offers Navalites an immersive journey into language and cultural heritage. In the Chinese Language Unit, students take on exciting Amazing Races, try their hand at traditional arts and games, and enjoy captivating drama performances. Over in the Malay Language Unit, students explore lyric-writing in hands-on workshops, and in 2024, had the unique opportunity to learn from musician Khair Yassi. They also enjoyed the play _Bawang Putih Bawang Merah_. Meanwhile, the Tamil Language Unit brings culture to life through traditional Indian drumming, allowing students to develop a deeper appreciation of its rich significance.
