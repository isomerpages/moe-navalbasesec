<p><strong>VISION: NURTURING ACTIVE LEARNERS AND PROFICIENT USERS</strong></p>
<p>The Mother Tongue department aims to equip Navalites with competency in using&nbsp;Mother Tongue languages as a communication tool and to develop in them an&nbsp;appreciation for the richness of their cultures and history. We believe that&nbsp;learning MTL enables our students to understand and develop their unique identities&nbsp;through a deeper appreciation of culture, traditions, literature and history.</p>
