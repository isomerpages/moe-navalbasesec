<p><strong>Curriculum Overview</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Food &amp; Consumer Education</strong>
</p>
<p>At Naval Base Secondary School, Food &amp; Consumer Education (FCE) empowers
students to be health-conscious, discerning consumers with essential life
skills. The curriculum, grounded in Food Studies and Consumer Studies,
equips students with foundational knowledge in food, nutrition, and consumerism.
This strong foundation prepares them for everyday living and progression
to upper secondary Nutrition &amp; Food Science (NFS), leading to further
studies in food and nutrition-related fields.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Nutrition &amp; Food Science</strong>
</p>
<p>Through the Nutrition &amp; Food Science (NFS) curriculum, students would
advocate nutrition and health for self, family and the community. They
will better appreciate how a variety of food, including consumer literacy
like financial literacy, is used in food management and the issues of food
security, including food safety and sustainable food consumption. They
will also apply scientific principles during food preparation and cooking.
With the appropriate knowledge and skills, they will become a health ambassador,
discerning consumer and food innovator.</p>
