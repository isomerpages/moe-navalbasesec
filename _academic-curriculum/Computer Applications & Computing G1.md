<p>The rapid advancement of technology and growing capabilities of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) will bring about significant changes to the way we learn,
work and play. Computing subjects provide support for this effort by providing

explore the field of Computing.</p>
<p>Through this skill-based subject, students will:
<br>• develop basic computational thinking skills along with 21st century
competencies
<br>• develop digital competencies in using digital tools to create digital
artefacts, process information, communicate effectively and solve simple
problems
<br>• appreciate the legal, ethical and security issues relating to the use
of computers, and
