<p><strong>Level 1 Programmes – Embrace</strong>
</p>
<p>At level 1, we design learning experiences within and beyond the classrooms
to embrace all students with diverse talents, abilities, and needs. These
learning experiencesenable students to demonstrate learning through authentic
settings such as ALP in Visual Art, digital literacy programmes, Inter-discplinary
Project Work, learning journeys, enrichment programmes, and Academic Intervention
Programmes.</p>
<p><strong>Level 2 Programmes – Enrich</strong>
</p>
<p>At level 2, we curate learning experiences to nurturing student interests
in specific disciplines. These experiences are for students who show a
keen interest and demonstrate strength in that field of interest.</p>
<p><strong>Level 3 Programmes - Excel or Engage</strong>
</p>
<p>At level 3, we offer opportunities for selected students seeking to challenge
themselves. These experiences encourage students to pursue their passions
at a higher level.</p>
<p>At the same time, we identify and engage students who may require additional
support through structured intervention programmes and support.
