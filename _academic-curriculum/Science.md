<p><strong>Department Vision<br /></strong>Guided by the principle that every child can learn and excel, and its vision - Inquiring Mind and Innovative Spirit - the Science Department constantly seeks to improve on the quality of interaction between the teacher and the learner, to bring out the best in our students. Based on the unique needs, aspirations and abilities of our students, differentiated programmes are designed and conducted to excite our students and help them to develop not just scientific knowledge and skills, but also acquire lifeskills and the values, attitudes and mindsets that will serve them well in life.</p>

<p><strong>Curriculum, Pedagogy and Assessment</strong></p>
<p>Our Science curriculum framework was derived from Ministry of Education&rsquo;s Policy Framework for the teaching and learning of Science which seeks to inculcate and nurture the spirit of inquiry and curiosity. This framework guides us in designing and crafting our lesson packages and enrichment program to provide an authentic learning experience for our students as well as develop the desired thinking dispositions in them and during the process bring about Joy of Learning for Science.</p>
<p>Our Science curriculum takes into consideration the different learning experiences for our students. Teachers are guided by the core ideas and essential question when they plan and deliver their lessons. We adopt the 5E Instructional Model to plan an inquiry-oriented student-centric lesson. Teachers are equipped with a repertoire of teaching strategies to cater to the different learning profile of the students. Examples of the teaching pedagogies used include teacher-directed learning, Socratic questioning, Making Thinking Visible routines, collaborative learning, flipped classroom, peer teaching, oral presentation, Cornell note-taking, mind mapping and the use of games for learning.</p>
<p>Our department also believes in using varied mode of assessments, ranging from oral presentations to projects to practical and written papers, to provide a holistic assessment of our students. Formative assessment in the form of quizzes and model making are also used to provide information of the extent of learning, understanding of concepts and mastery of skills.</p>

<p><strong>Overview of Science Curriculum</strong></p>
<img src="/images/sci3.png">
<p><strong>(A) Key Programmes<br /></strong><strong>Sec 1 Show &amp; Tell</strong></p>
<p>Since 2015, Secondary 1 students&nbsp;have been given opportunities to&nbsp;demonstrate their understanding of scientific principles or concepts through simple experiments or model- or toy-making. As independent learners, students acquire knowledge beyond the textbooks and are given opportunities to ask questions and reflection during presentations.</p>
<img src="/images/sci4.png">
<p><strong>Sec 2 Inquiry-Based Project</strong></p>
<p>Since 2013, Secondary Two Express students have been involved in an inquiry-based project with the objective of inculcating in students a spirit of scientific inquiry as they expand their learning beyond classroom. Students learn to apply creative and critical thinking skills and foster collaboration when they work with their team members. They also acquire the essential scientific process skills, including interpreting and analysing experimental data, and making logical conclusions. At the same time, students hone their communication skills when they present their projects to their peers and teachers.</p>
<img src="/images/sci5.png">
<p><strong>(B) Competitions<br /></strong><strong>Scientific Inquiry Research Experience @ Republic Polytechnic</strong></p>
<p>The Scientific Inquiry Research Experience gives Navalites an avenue to conceptualize creative Science projects that aim to find innovative solutions to everyday problems or that use the scientific method to prove or disprove phenomena.</p>
<p>Navalites get to observe first-hand that Science is a dynamic process where researchers often make new discoveries and re-examine earlier knowledge to try to improve, build upon, or extend on it.</p>
<p>Through this programme, Navalites&nbsp;develop a variety of skills such as their ability to:</p>
<p>- gather, process and organize information</p>
<p>- manipulate materials and scientific instruments</p>
<p>- analyse data and communicate their findings to others</p>
<p>Through the process, Navalites develop new ways of thinking about and approaching a problem.</p>

<p>On the 13th of July, two teams from class 3-5 participated in the&nbsp;Math and Science Challenge organised by Jurong Pioneer Junior College. The challenge required them to bring forth their knowledge in the subjects of Math, Physics, Chemistry and Biology. During the science challenge, they had to collaborate in teams and listen to each other&rsquo;s views as they were stretched to think out of the box to solve the questions. Although the questions were unfamiliar to them, they had to adapt by tapping on each other&rsquo;s strengths.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One team emerged 4th runner-up! It was definitely an enriching experience for all of them</p>

<p><strong>National Crystal Growing&nbsp;<br /></strong><br />NBSS Chemistry Department has embarked on crystal growing since 2011, when our students first emerged Top for overall schools in the YJC Crystal Growing Competition<br /><br />In 2012, our boys team achieved overall championship at the National Crystal Growing Competition organised by National University Of Singapore (NUS). Three of our students were given an honorary mention for the International crystal growing competition in 2014. Three teams of our students participated in the same competition organised by NUS this year. The journey has greatly enriched our students with good experimental skills and instilled in them traits like discipline and perseverance. Our teachers too have gained much expertise in crystal growing.&nbsp;<br /><br />Since 2014, we have established a yearly structured Crystal Growing Enrichment Programme for our Secondary Three Normal Academic students. This programme has aroused many of our students&rsquo; interest and allowed them to enjoy the fun side of Chemistry. As we explore the sustainability of this programme, we hope to continue working with our students to discover not just crystal growing techniques, but scientific thinking skills via research work.</p>
