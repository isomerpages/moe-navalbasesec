<p><strong>Department Vision<br></strong>Guided by the principle that every
child can learn and excel, and its vision - Inquiring Mind and Innovative
Spirit - the Science Department is dedicated to shaping every child into
an adaptive, collaborative, and excellence-driven learner.</p>
<p>We recognize that each student is unique, with different strengths, challenges,
and learning styles, and we aim to cultivate adaptability by encouraging
students to approach problems with flexibility and resilience.</p>
<p>Through collaborative learning opportunities, we foster teamwork, communication,
and shared problem-solving, helping students learn from one another and
build essential skills for working in diverse environments.</p>
<p>At the same time, we instill a drive for excellence by setting high standards,
challenging students to push beyond their limits, and inspiring them to
pursue mastery in both scientific knowledge and personal growth.</p>
<p>By nurturing these qualities, we empower students to become future-ready
learners who excel in all aspects of their academic and personal lives.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Curriculum, Pedagogy and Assessment</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Science curriculum framework was derived from Ministry of Education’s
Policy Framework for the teaching and learning of Science which seeks to
inculcate and nurture the spirit of inquiry and curiosity. This framework
guides us in designing and crafting our lesson packages and enrichment
program to provide an authentic learning experience for our students as
well as develop the desired thinking dispositions in them and during the
process bring about Joy of Learning for Science.</p>
<p>Our Science curriculum takes into consideration the different learning
experiences for our students. Teachers are guided by the core ideas and
essential question when they plan and deliver their lessons. We adopt the
5E Instructional Model to plan an inquiry-oriented student-centric lesson.
Teachers are equipped with a repertoire of teaching strategies to cater
to the different learning profile of the students. Examples of the teaching
pedagogies used include teacher-directed learning, Socratic questioning,
Making Thinking Visible routines, collaborative learning, flipped classroom,
peer teaching, oral presentation, Cornell note-taking, mind mapping and
the use of games for learning.</p>
<p>Our department also believes in using varied mode of assessments, ranging
from oral presentations to projects to practical and written papers, to
provide a holistic assessment of our students. Formative assessment in
the form of quizzes and model making are also used to provide information
of the extent of learning, understanding of concepts and mastery of skills.</p>

<p><strong>Signature STEM ExCEL Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Our STEM ExCEL Programme is an enrichment programme that aims to strengthen
the interest and capabilities of our students in STEM. We want our students
to be curious about the world around them, to think creatively and critically
in solving problems and to be concerned citizens who make positive difference
to the life of others.</p>
