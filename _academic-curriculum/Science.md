<p><strong>Department Vision<br></strong>Guided by the principle that every
child can learn and excel, and its vision - Inquiring Mind and Innovative
Spirit - the Science Department is dedicated to shaping every child into
an adaptive, collaborative, and excellence-driven learner.</p>
<p>We recognize that each student is unique, with different strengths, challenges,
and learning styles, and we aim to cultivate adaptability by encouraging
students to approach problems with flexibility and resilience.</p>
<p>Through collaborative learning opportunities, we foster teamwork, communication,
and shared problem-solving, helping students learn from one another and
build essential skills for working in diverse environments.</p>
<p>At the same time, we instill a drive for excellence by setting high standards,
challenging students to push beyond their limits, and inspiring them to
pursue mastery in both scientific knowledge and personal growth.</p>
<p>By nurturing these qualities, we empower students to become future-ready
learners who excel in all aspects of their academic and personal lives.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Curriculum, Pedagogy and Assessment</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Science curriculum is grounded in the Ministry of Education's Policy
Framework, fostering inquiry and curiosity. Aligned with our department’s
vision, we design lessons and enrichment programs that provide authentic
learning experiences and cultivate the joy of learning, while developing
adaptive, collaborative, and excellence-driven learners.</p>
<p>Teachers create student-centered lessons based on core concepts and essential
questions, employing strategies like feedback pedagogy, e-pedagogy, differentiated
instruction, questioning techniques, thinking routines, and collaborative
learning. These approaches cater to diverse learning profiles, promoting
adaptability, teamwork, and critical thinking.</p>
<p>To support our excellence-driven focus, we use a range of assessments—projects,
practical tasks, and written exams—to provide a holistic view of student
progress. These assessments are designed to challenge students, encourage
self-reflection, and measure mastery of scientific concepts and skills.
Through ongoing feedback, we aim to empower students to track their growth
and continue to develop the skills needed to excel.</p>

<p><strong>STEM EXCEL Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>“And beyond that – we want our people to have a <strong>sense of curiosity</strong> to <strong>explore</strong> and <strong>experiment</strong>,
to create and <strong>innovate</strong>, and to have an open mind to new
ideas. This will be our competitive advantage going into the future; <strong>framing</strong>  <strong>tomorrow's challenges</strong>,
and <strong>finding tomorrow's solutions</strong> ahead of time using <strong>STEM</strong>.”</p>
<p>Education Minister Chan Chun Sing</p>
<p>As such we need to equip our students with the skills and mindsets, to
empower them to thrive in an ever-evolving world.</p>
<p>Our STEM ExCEL Programme is designed to ignite students' passion for STEM
and enhance their skills in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.
Through this programme, we aim to cultivate <strong>curiosity</strong> about
the world, foster <strong>creative</strong> and critical problem-solving
abilities, and nurture socially responsible citizens who strive to make
a <strong>meaningful impact</strong> on others' lives.</p>
