<p><strong><u>Research Scholars Programme</u>&nbsp;(RSP)<br></strong>RSP
is offered to students who show keen interest and potential in numeracy,
scientific inquiry and problem-solving. Scholars will also get to develop
creative academic games and organise competitions in the area of Mathematics
and Science.&nbsp;In addition, they will be involved in research projects
with higher institutions and attachment programmes with industrial partners.</p>
<p><strong><u>English Language Scholars Programme</u>&nbsp;(ELSP)<br></strong>ELSP
focuses on the finer aspects of communications and is offered to students
with a flair for the English Language. Besides gaining additional exposure
at public speaking competitions, scholars will also be required to produce
several pieces of written work at a standard worthy of publication.</p>
<p><strong><u>Art Talent Development Programme</u>&nbsp;(ATDP)<br></strong>The
ATDP is a 4 to 5 year CCA-based programme providing students with a keen
interest and talent in art to pursue art outside of curriculum time. Students
may apply based on interest and are not required to offer art at upper
secondary level.</p>
<p>Aside from developing their personal practice and portfolio, students
on the ATDP will also participate in key developmental programmes at different
stages of their studies. For example, Secondary 2 students will participate
in a 6-week curation module at the National Gallery Singapore; at Secondary
3, they will organise the schoolâ€™s annual art exhibition.</p>
