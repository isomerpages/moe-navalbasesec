<p>At Naval Base Secondary School, we are dedicated to nurturing each student's
unique talents and abilities. As part of our 3E Approach to developing
students (Embrace, Engage, and Excel), our Talent Development Programme
(TDP) offers students opportunities to excel in areas outside of the standard
curriculum, challenging their thinking in the process. From Mathematics
board game design to public speaking, to storytelling and innovative Science
projects, the TDP encourages excelling Navalites to explore new ideas and
address real-world challenges.

<p>In Secondary 2, enrichment opportunities emphasise problem-solving and
scientific concepts, utilising Design Thinking to address both everyday
challenges and global environmental and health issues. This hands-on learning
approach encourages students to think critically and creatively, enabling
them to contribute to global issues such as food security and environmental
sustainability. One standout in the 2024 project was the development of
a foldable hydro-case for a vertical farm within the school—an initiative
that earned the Encouragement Award at the 2024 Tan Kah Kee Young Inventors’
Award.</p>
<p>The students also have the opportunity to learn the strategic game of
chess and take on leadership roles by organising a school-wide chess competition.</p>

<p><strong>Secondary 1<br></strong>The Secondary 1 TDP students learn about
the gamification process and work together to create board games that would
excite their peers. Previous years saw them creating two Math games, <em>Math Storm </em>which
focuses on Arithmethic and <em>Naval Nexus</em>, which focuses on alegebraic
equations. The students develop creativity and critical thinking as they
applied mathematical concepts to create an interactive learning experience.</p>
<p><strong>Secondary 2<br></strong>In Secondary 2, enrichment opportunites
focus on problem-solving and scientific concepts, designing solutions to
address both everyday issues and global environmental and health challenges.
One standout in 2024 project involved developing a foldable hydro case
for a vertical farm within the school—an initiative submitted for the Tan
Kah Kee Young Inventors’ Award. This hands-on approach to learning encouraged
students to think critically and innovatively, contributing to global issues
like food security and environmental sustainability.</p>

<p><strong>Secondary 3<br></strong>Our senior students extended their passion
for literacy by volunteering to read to primary school children as part
of the National Library’s KidsRead Programme. They designed engaging slides
and organised craft activities to introduce younger students to the world
of reading. Their efforts not only fostered a love of books in the younger
children but also helped create a supportive, engaging learning environment
for the community.</p>

<p>Some of these notable TDP students also went on to excel in public speaking
competitions, and often take on the role of Student Ambassadors for the
school during key hosting events. Excelling groups of TDP students also
went on further to take part in the Model United Nations Conference.</p>
