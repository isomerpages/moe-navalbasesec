<p>At Naval Base Secondary School, we are dedicated to nurturing each student's
unique talents and abilities. As part of our 3E Approach to developing
students (Embrace, Engage, and Excel), our Talent Development Programme
(TDP) offers students opportunities to excel in areas outside of the standard
curriculum, challenging their thinking in the process. From Mathematics
board game design to public speaking, to storytelling and innovative Science
projects, the TDP encourages excelling Navalites to explore new ideas and
address real-world challenges.
<br>
<br><strong><u>Programme Objectives:</u></strong>
<br>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To nurture self-directed learners,
creative and critical thinkers who can communicate effectively</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To develop confident,
resilient and empathetic individuals who use their talents to actively
contribute to others</p>

<p>Secondary 1 students explore the gamification process and collaborate
to design board games and interactive learning experiences aimed at engaging
their peers. Past projects have included math-themed games such as Math
Storm, which focuses on arithmetic, and Naval Nexus, which centers on algebraic
equations. Through these projects, students enhance their creativity and
critical thinking skills as they create fun, educational experiences for
their peers.</p>

<p>In Secondary 2, enrichment opportunities emphasise problem-solving and
scientific concepts, utilising Design Thinking to address both everyday
challenges and global environmental and health issues. This hands-on learning
approach encourages students to think critically and creatively, enabling
them to contribute to global issues such as food security and environmental
sustainability. One standout in the 2024 project was the development of
a foldable hydro-case for a vertical farm within the school—an initiative
that earned the Encouragement Award at the 2024 Tan Kah Kee Young Inventors’
Award.</p>
<p>The students also have the opportunity to learn the strategic game of
chess and take on leadership roles by organising a school-wide chess competition.</p>

activities to introduce primary school children to the joys of reading.
Through their efforts, they foster a love of books in younger students
while cultivating a supportive and engaging learning environment for the
