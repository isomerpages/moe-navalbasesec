<p><strong>The Naval Base Scholars Programme</strong></p>
<p>At Naval Base, we grow leaders of character and ignite the passion in our students to put in their best and achieve excellence in their areas of interest.</p>
<p>The Naval Base Scholars Programme is an exclusive programme customised to provide an enriched and challenging learning experience for high-achieving students. This programme provides these selected students with the additional edge to succeed in life through specially crafted programmes. The selection process commences at Secondary 1 and selected students are invited to join one of the following:</p>

<li><strong> Research Scholars Programme </strong></li>
<li><strong>English Language Scholars Programme</strong></li>
<li><strong>Art Talent Development Progamme</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The Naval Base Scholars Programme houses a wide array of intensive and stimulating programmes and activities that provide opportunities and platforms to meet the cognitive needs of the students and monitor their development.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Research Scholars Programme</strong></u><strong>&nbsp;(RSP)<br></strong>RSP is offered to students who show keen interest and potential in numeracy, scientific inquiry and problem-solving. Scholars will also get to develop creative academic games and organise competitions in the area of Mathematics and Science.&nbsp;In addition, they will be involved in research projects with higher institutions and attachment programmes with industrial partners.</p>
<p><u><strong>English Language Scholars Programme</strong></u><strong>&nbsp;(ELSP)<br></strong>ELSP focuses on the finer aspects of communications and is offered to students with a flair for the English Language. Besides gaining additional exposure at public speaking competitions, scholars will also be required to produce several pieces of written work at a standard worthy of publication.</p>
<p><strong><u>Art Talent Development Programme</u>&nbsp;(ATDP)<br></strong>The ATDP is a 4 to 5 year CCA-based programme providing students with a keen interest and talent in art to pursue art outside of curriculum time. Students may apply based on interest and are not required to offer art at upper secondary level.</p>
<p>Aside from developing their personal practice and portfolio, students on the ATDP will also participate in key developmental programmes at different stages of their studies. For example, Secondary 2 students will participate in a 6-week curation module at the National Gallery Singapore; at Secondary 3, they will organise the schoolâ€™s annual art exhibition.</p>
<p>Students on the ATDP are eligible to apply for the NBSS-Crete Art Scholarship.</p>
