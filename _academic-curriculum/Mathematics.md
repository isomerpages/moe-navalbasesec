<p><strong>DEPARTMENT VISION</strong>
</p>
<p>The Mathematics department aims to provide a nurturing and diversified
experience for students pursuing mathematics that focuses on mathematical
problem solving. Mathematics problem solving is central to mathematics
learning as it involves the acquisition and application of mathematics
concepts and skills in a wide range of situations, including non-routine,
open-ended and real-world situations. The development of mathematical problem
solving ability is dependent on five inter-related components, namely Concepts,
Skills, Processes, Attitudes and Metacognition.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>CURRICULUM OVERVIEW</strong>
</p>
<p>The Mathemtics Curriculum focuses on three strands namely Numbers and
Algebra, Geometry and Measurement and Statistics and Probability, equipping
students with essential concepts and skills, fostering critical thinking,
problem-solving, and confidence. Through a structured approach, students
connect mathematical ideas across disciplines while developing reasoning
and communication skills.</p>

<p>Teachers employ diverse strategies, including Bloom’s Taxonomy questioning
and Polya’s Four-Step Approach, to scaffold problem-solving. At the lower
secondary level, the Concrete→Pictorial→Abstract (CPA) approach supports
concept mastery, while the ICAN framework helps address learning gaps.
In addition, a programme specially designed by NBSS teachers, Project Cube,
helps Secondary One learners bridge gaps faced when transitioning from
the primary school curriculum.</p>
<p>Technology enhances learning through self-assessment and collaboration,
while competitions such as the Math and Science Challenge, Mathematics
Trail, Arithmeteq Competition, Sudoku Challenge, <em>Pi Week</em>, and the
Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad push Navalites to think critically
and apply mathematics to real-world problems.</p>
<p>Students are given opportunities to be exposed to various competitions
such as the Math and Science Challenge, Mathematics Trail, Arithmeteq Competition,
Sudoku Challenge and the Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad. Navalites
are exposed to mathematical problems that challenged them to think critically
and out of the box to solve real life problems.</p>
