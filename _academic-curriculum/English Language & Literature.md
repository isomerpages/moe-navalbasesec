<p>At NBSS, the English Department cultivates confident communicators and critical thinkers through an engaging and authentic curriculum. Each year, Navalites participate in real-world tasks such as producing food vlogs, creating podcasts, and engaging in debates. The thematically linked units of work and the 3E approach to enrichment programmes expose Navalites to diverse issues and develop them to be critical thinkers, empathetic listeners and effective communicators.

Beyond the classroom, learning journeys deepen studentsâ€™ understanding of language and society. Secondary Three students visit Little India to explore the challenges faced by migrant workers, gaining insights through an interdisciplinary collaboration with the Social Studies and Citizenship Education team.

Programmes such as _Grammar Around the School_ refine language skills by addressing common grammar and academic writing challenges. To encourage creative expression, the department organises an _Intra-school Narrative Writing Competition_ and submits student entries to national competitions, including the _Creative Arts Programme_ and _Live On! Writing Competition_. Selected works are published in _Ink and Inspiration_, celebrating students' literary talents.

Literature comes alive through immersive experiences. The biennial _Get Lit!_ festival engages lower secondary students with interactive activities such as Escape Rooms and puzzles. Upper Secondary students expand their literary appreciation by attending live performances at venues like the Victoria Theatre, where they engage with directors and performers.

To foster a strong reading culture, _Reading Ambassadors_ lead initiatives such as book talks, movie screenings, and craft sessions, inspiring their peers while honing their confidence.

Through these initiatives, the English Department empowers Navalites with the skills to communicate effectively, think critically, and develop a lifelong appreciation for language and literature. </p>
