<p>At NBSS, the English Department cultivates confident communicators and
critical thinkers through an engaging and authentic curriculum. Each year,
Navalites participate in real-world tasks such as producing food vlogs,
creating podcasts, and engaging in debates. The thematically linked units
of work and the 3E approach to enrichment programmes expose Navalites to
diverse issues and develop them to be critical thinkers, empathetic listeners
and effective communicators.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Journeys and Enrichment Opportunities</strong>
</p>
<p>Beyond the classroom,<strong> </strong>learning journeys deepen students’
understanding of language and society. Secondary Three students visit Little
India to explore the challenges faced by migrant workers, gaining insights
through an interdisciplinary collaboration with the Social Studies and
Citizenship Education team.</p>

<p>Programmes such as <em>Grammar Around the School</em> refine language skills
by addressing common grammar and academic writing challenges. To encourage
creative expression, the department organises an <em>Intra-school Narrative Writing Competition</em> and
submits student entries to national competitions, including the <em>Creative Arts Programme</em> and <em>Live On! Writing Competition</em>.
Selected works are published in <em>Ink and Inspiration</em>, celebrating
students' literary talents.</p>
<p><strong>Literature Unit</strong>
</p>
<p>Literature comes alive through immersive experiences. The biennial <em>Get Lit!</em> festival
engages lower secondary students with interactive activities such as Escape
Rooms and puzzles. Upper Secondary students expand their literary appreciation
by attending live performances at venues like the Victoria Theatre, where
they engage with directors and performers.</p>

<p>To foster a strong reading culture, <em>Reading Ambassadors</em> lead initiatives
such as book talks, movie screenings, and craft sessions, inspiring their
peers while honing their confidence.</p>
<p>Through these initiatives, the English Department empowers Navalites with
the skills to communicate effectively, think critically, and develop a
lifelong appreciation for language and literature.</p>
