<h4><strong>Enhanced Art Programme</strong></h4>
<p>The Enhanced Art Programme (EAP) is a Ministry of Education initiative
introduced in 2011 to provide greater opportunities for students with keen
disposition and capability in art to develop their talent. It is a two-year
programme that provides an enriched learning environment for Secondary
3 and 4 students who are inclined towards art. From 2017, a total of nine
schools in Singapore will offer the programme.</p>
<p>The EAP is offered to all upper secondary art students and delivered during
curriculum time. Aside from the enhanced learning opportunities that stretch
students’ talents and groom them for artistic excellence, students will
also get to experience artist mentorship and artist talks to support their
art learning and growth. In line with this, the school has two art studios,
one ceramics, a school’s in-house art gallery to better support its EAP
and larger ALP.&nbsp;</p>
