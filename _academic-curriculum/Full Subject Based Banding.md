<p>Offering of Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary 2</p>
</td>
<td width="510">
<p>Currently, secondary school students can offer&nbsp;<strong>English Language, Mother Tongue Languages,</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Mathematics and Science&nbsp;</strong>at a more demanding level from the start of Secondary One based on students&rsquo; PSLE Achievement Level (AL) for each subject. Beyond the start of Secondary 1, students may also offer these subjects at a more demanding level based on their performance in secondary school.</p>
<p>Our school will also provide Secondary 2 students the opportunity to take Humanities subjects at a more demanding level, if they meet subject-specific criteria. This is applicable to students who are in the Normal (Technical) course from 2024.</p>
<p>The criteria for taking Humanities at a more demanding level will be based on students&rsquo; aptitude for and interest in these subjects at&nbsp;Secondary 1.&nbsp;They should also possess positive attitude towards learning and strong commitment to offer the subject at a more demanding level.</p>

<p>Mixed form classes with the provision of a common curriculum</p>
</td>
<td width="510">
<p>Our school will implement mixed form classes starting from the&nbsp;<strong>Secondary 1 cohort of students entering our school in 2023.</strong></p>
<p>The 2023 cohort of Secondary 1 students will be grouped in mixed form classes, comprising students from different courses of study.&nbsp;Mixed form classes present more opportunities for students to interact with other students taking different subject combinations, and with different strengths and interests.</p>
<p>In their mixed form classes, students will take a set of subjects at a common level, amounting to about one-third of curriculum time. This would allow students in mixed form classes to spend curriculum time together in these subjects.</p>
<p>These subjects are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Art</li>
<li>Character and Citizenship Education</li>
<li>Design and Technology</li>
<li>Food and Consumer Education</li>
<li>Music</li>
<li>Physical Education</li>
</ul>
<p>Teachers will adopt a range of teaching approaches to meet the different learning needs and pace of their students in the same form class.</p>
<p>English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics, and Science will continue to be offered at Express Level, N(A) Level, and N(T) Level. The criteria for taking these subjects at a more demanding level from the start of Secondary One is based on students&rsquo; PSLE AL Score for each subject. Students will be grouped in different classes based on their subject level for each subject.</p>
