<h4><strong>Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB)</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Full Subject-Based Banding<br></strong>Naval Base Secondary School
has been implementing Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) since 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose of Full SBB<br></strong>Full SBB is part of MOE’s ongoing
efforts to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to
cater to the different strengths and interests of our students.</p>
<p>Full SBB includes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Offering of Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary
2; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mixed form classes with the provision of a common curriculum.</p>

</ul>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Previously, secondary school students can offer&nbsp;<strong>English Language, Mother Tongue Languages,</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Mathematics and Science&nbsp;</strong>at
a more demanding level from the start of Secondary One based on students’
PSLE Achievement Level (AL) for each subject. Beyond the start of Secondary
1, students may also offer these subjects at a more demanding level based
on their performance in secondary school.</p>
<p></p>
<p>NBSS also provides Secondary 2 students the opportunity to take Humanities
subjects at a more demanding level, if they meet subject-specific criteria.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For G1 students, the criteria to take Humanities at a more demanding level
will be based on students’ aptitude for and interest in these subjects
at&nbsp;Secondary 1.&nbsp;They should also possess positive attitude towards
learning and strong commitment to offer the subject at a more demanding
level.</p>

<p>Mixed form classes with the provision of a common curriculum</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>NBSS implemented mixed form classes starting from 2023 Secondary 1 students.
They are grouped in mixed form classes, comprising students from different
courses of study.&nbsp;Mixed form classes present more opportunities for
students to interact with other students taking different subject combinations,
and with different strengths and interests.</p>
<p>In their mixed form classes, students take a set of subjects at a common
level, amounting to about one-third of curriculum time. This allows students
in mixed form classes to spend curriculum time together in these subjects:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Art</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design and Technology</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Food and Consumer Education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Music</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical Education</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Teachers adopt a range of teaching approaches to meet the different learning
needs and pace of their students in the same form class.</p>
<p>English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics, and Science will
continue to be offered at G3, G2 and G1. The criteria for taking these
subjects at a more demanding level from the start of Secondary One is based
on students’ PSLE AL Score for each subject. Students will be grouped in
different classes based on their subject level for each subject.</p>
