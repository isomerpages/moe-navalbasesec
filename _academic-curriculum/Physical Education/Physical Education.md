<p>The NBSS PE Department believes that our curriculum should not only promote students' physical, but also mental and social well-being. Furthermore, each student should be empowered to achieve success, regardless of physical attributes.&nbsp;</p>

Sports and physical activities create both planned and spontaneous teachable moments through their emotional and physical demands. The disciplined preparation phase - from training to maintaining proper nutrition - coupled with the unpredictable nature of actual performance, naturally develops character and essential life skills in our students.

Building on this foundation, our Physical Education (PE) Department leads the school's Learning for Life Programme (LLP), shaping students holistically through sports. Our comprehensive PE programme develops broad-based physical competencies while creating meaningful recreational opportunities that nurture students' mental and emotional growth.

**Programme Reach**

Our PE programme engages every student in the school, ensuring that all students, regardless of their athletic ability, have opportunities to develop physically, mentally, and emotionally through sports and physical activities.
