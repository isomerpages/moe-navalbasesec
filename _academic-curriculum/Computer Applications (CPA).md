<p><strong>Programmes</strong></p>

<p>From 2025, the Upper Secondary syllabus will focus on higher-order thinking skills. Basic programming concepts and skills will be learnt through animation and game design and applying them to solve problems in everyday context. This prepares them for further studies in programming, ICT or media-related courses, and also for work and future learning.</p>
<p>Students will have opportunities to do creative work with animation and game development projects in Secondary 2 and 3 respectively using the Scratch software developed by MIT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 2020, our Secondary 2 and Secondary 3 CPA students have done well in the Animation and Game Making Competition organised In 2020, we obtained a Bronze Award, and in 2021 the Gold Award! In 2023, our Navalite Harith Irfan Bin Hasli was awarded Silver in the Animation category, and subsequently in 2024 a Bronze in the Game Making Category. This year also saw Joji Quah obtaining a Bronze in the Animation Category. </p>
