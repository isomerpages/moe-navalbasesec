<p><strong>Programmes</strong></p>
<p>Students will be exposed to internet technologies and readily available tools through hands-on activities in this skill-based subject. Problem sets integrating software applications are designed to guide in preparing for real life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lower Secondary syllabus equips students with fundamental ICT skills supporting lifelong learning and are useful for their personal life. These skills form the foundation for learning CPA at upper secondary.</p><img style="width: 40%;" src="/images/cpa1.jpeg" align="right">
<p>The Upper Secondary syllabus focuses on higher-order thinking skills. Basic programming concepts and skills will be learnt through animation and game design and applying them to solve problems in everyday context. This prepares them for further studies in programming, ICT or media-related courses, and also for work and future learning.</p>
<p>Students will have opportunities to do creative work with animation and game development projects in Secondary 2 and 3 respectively using the Scratch software developed by MIT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 2016, all Secondary 2 and Secondary 3 CPA students participate in the National Media Computing Competition held by MOE. In 2020, now known as Animation and Game Making Competition, saw us clinching a Bronze Award, and in 2021 the Gold Award! In 2023, the school is proud to announce that Harith Irfan Bin Hasli was awarded Silver, in the Animation category.
