<p><strong>Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>Students will be exposed to internet technologies and readily available
tools through hands-on activities in this skill-based subject. Problem
sets integrating software applications are designed to guide in preparing
for real life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From 2025, the Upper Secondary syllabus will focus on higher-order thinking
skills. Basic programming concepts and skills will be learnt through animation
and game design and applying them to solve problems in everyday context.
This prepares them for further studies in programming, ICT or media-related
courses, and also for work and future learning.</p>
<p>Students will have opportunities to do creative work with animation and
game development projects in Secondary 2 and 3 respectively using the Scratch
software developed by MIT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 2020, our Secondary 2 and Secondary 3 CPA students have done well
in the Animation and Game Making Competition organised In 2020, we obtained
a Bronze Award, and in 2021 the Gold Award! In 2023, our Navalite Harith
Irfan Bin Hasli was awarded Silver in the Animation category, and subsequently
in 2024 a Bronze in the Game Making Category. This year also saw Joji Quah
obtaining a Bronze in the Animation Category.</p>
