<p><strong>Music</strong></p>
<p>The school&rsquo;s music programme helps develop students&rsquo; musical knowledge as well as an understanding and appreciation of music in a manner both meaningful and relevant to students.</p>
<p>Through music learning, students also develop extra-musical skills and 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century competencies, such as critical thinking, psychomotor skills, social awareness, and moral and cultural values, all of which contribute to their holistic development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The aims of the NBSS Music Programme are as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;Develop awareness and appreciation of music in local and global cultures</li>
<li>&nbsp;Develop ability for creative expression and communication through music</li>
<li>&nbsp;Provide basis to develop informed and life-long involvement in music</li>
</ul>
<p>At the Upper Secondary level, students who are keen to further their music studies may offer Music as a GCE Ordinary- or Normal (Technical)-Level subject, provided they meet the basic requirements of the respective courses. More information can be found on the respective pages.
