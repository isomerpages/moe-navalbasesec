<p><strong>Programming Tiers</strong></p>
<p>The NBSS ALP in Art is delivered in two tiers, namely the Pervasive and Specialist Tracks. They cater to all students and students with interest and talent in art respectively. The programmes in the Pervasive Track help students acquire basic art knowledge and competencies as well as artistic habits of mind that may be translated to other disciplines and areas of their lives. They also develop in them a greater understanding of and appreciation for art. The programmes in the Specialist Track help students acquire the skills, knowledge and attitudes that provide a strong foundation for the further pursuit of art as an educational and career pathway.&nbsp;<br /><strong><br />Learning Domains</strong></p>
<p>Learning is organised according to three learning domains. They encapsulate the cognitive, psychomotor and affective dimensions of students&rsquo; engagement in art, and operate in a dynamic and inter-connected manner to develop the students&rsquo; visual literacy and aesthetic sense. They are:<br /><br /><u>Perceiving &amp; Interpreting</u></p>
<p>Students will learn to pay attention to and experience the full range of visual phenomena that surround them. Through observation and analysis of visual stimuli in nature, the man-made environment and works of art and design, students develop visual awareness and sensitivities that encourage imagination. They learn to gather and organise information, and use that information to generate and explore a variety of ideas, materials, techniques and technologies to realise their intentions. Through investigation and exploration of problems, ideas and solutions, students discover creative ways to problem-solve.<br /><br /><u>Creating &amp; Communicating</u></p>
<p>Students will develop practical and process skills to express their thoughts, experiences and feelings in visual and tactile forms. They learn elements of art and principles of design and develop visual literacy and aesthetic sensibility to create art or design works. They develop basic competency in a variety of materials, media and art forms, and acquire an understanding of artistic processes to generate artworks that offer insight into who they are.<br /><u><br />Appreciating</u></p>
<p>Students will value art as a means of expression. They learn to discuss and respond to their own artworks and the works of others using art discussion approaches. They learn to see the relevance of art to their lives and better appreciate its significance in the social, cultural and economic fabric of contemporary society. They learn to reflect on and assess their own practice and recognise their strengths and inclinations. Through this, students learn to recognise the possibilities that a lifelong pursuit of art has to offer.<br /><strong><br />Learning Outcomes</strong></p>
<p>The specific learning outcomes for the programme are articulated within the learning domains, according to the two programming tracks.</p>
