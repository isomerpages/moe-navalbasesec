<p><strong>Structured Art Enrichment Programmes</strong></p>
<p>Through our structured art enrichment programmes, all students will have opportunities to continue to engage in art enrichment activities such as workshops and learning journeys throughout their 4-5 years in the school. The programmes are usually held during the post-exam period at the end of each semester.</p>

<p><strong>Art Events</strong></p>
<p>Every year, the school holds an Art Week, to celebrate the launch of the annual art exhibition. During that week, students get to participate in a variety of art activities on a sign-up basis. Aside from the Art Week, there are frequent ad-hoc art events such as Staff Art Appreciation sessions and Art assembly programmes. These help to contribute to a vibrant arts experience for the students and staff.</p>
