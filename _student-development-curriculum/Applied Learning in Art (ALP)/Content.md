third_nav_title: Applied Learning in Art (ALP)
---

<p>In both the Pervasive and Specialist Tracks, students will develop practical skills in:&middot;</p>
<ul>
<li>two-dimensional art forms, e.g. drawing, painting, printmaking;</li>
<li>three-dimensional art forms, e.g. sculpture using ceramics;</li>
<li>design, e.g. character design, fashion design, graphic design; and</li>
<li>digital media, e.g. digital imaging, digital illustration.</li>
</ul>
<p>These provide the platform for the critical study and discussion of artists, artworks and art concepts as well as aesthetic principles.</p>
<p>In the Specialist Track, students&rsquo; learning experiences will be extended to real-world application of their art learning; ranging from planning and curating art exhibitions, visiting places of art-related work as well as working with practising artists.</p>
<p>The NBSS formal Art curriculum comprises the GAP and EAP at the lower and upper secondary levels respectively. The EAP is delivered through the upper secondary Art formal curriculum and an extended programme conducted after curriculum hours. The curriculum outline, which illustrates the progression of learning at the different levels, is given below.</p>
