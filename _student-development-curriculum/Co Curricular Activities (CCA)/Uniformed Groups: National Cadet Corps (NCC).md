<p>NBSS NCC aims to develop resourceful, responsible, resilient, loyal leaders and team players through fun and challenging military-related activities. In collaboration with the NCC HQ, the unit offers the cadets with a variety of fun and challenging activities that are meaningful in developing our cadets&rsquo; full potential.</p>
<p>Other than having the opportunity to organize the weekly training sessions, our cadet leaders had multiple opportunities to organize and execute other activities. This includes our unit&rsquo;s Annual Camp and Cluster Training. Through the planning and execution of these events, our cadet leaders learnt how to work together as a team and also the importance of effective communication.</p>
<p>Each year, NBSS conducts a 2D1N camp in school with the objective of enabling cadet leaders to plan and execute the camp program, promoting cohesion amongst the cadets and to develop their mental resilience. They participated in team-building activities, outfield meals with Meal, Ready-to-Eat (MRE) packs and a night-activity involving urban ops.</p>
<p>Our unit also prepares for the annual Precision Drill Squad (PDS) and Freestyle Exhibition Drill (FSD) competition organized by HQ NCC. Our PDS team executes rifle drills in complex series of movements with great co-ordination and precision while our FSD team performs and displays a vibrant array of drills and movements. The three-term long preparation is all planned and executed by our selected Cadet Leaders, under the supervision of our Teacher Officers.</p>
<p>While numerous activities are currently cancelled or postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the unit is hopeful that the situation will improve and looking forward to the gradual resumption of more activities in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To serve with pride and dedication, NCC!</p>
