<p>The Art Club of Naval Base Secondary School is made up of 4 wings; Floral Art, 2D Art and Design, 3D Art (Ceramics) and the Art Talent Development Programme. Sec 1 students will experience seven-week attachment to the first 3 Art Wings, before specialising in one of their choices from Secondary 2 onwards. The members of ATDP are made up of our DSA students and those who are ready to be further stretched. They have applied in through their art portfolio submission and interviews by the Art teachers. Our students learn various specialised skills, foster bonding among peers and create authentic projects that contribute directly to the school and community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a few key events which our students are involved in, namely the bi-annual Singapore Youth Festival Art Exhibition, the Art Immersion Programme for Primary 6 students, setting up, organising and curating our annual Naval Base Secondary School Art Exhibition. The Sec 2s ATDP members attended the 6 week Learn to Curate Programme held in collaboration with the National Gallery Singapore. In addition, the main Ex-committee members supported our Art Department teachers to run the annual Open House to the public and participate in community outreach programmes with the relevant strategic partners in our effort to serve and bond with the community.</p>
<p>Students have also shown competitive greatness through their participation in competitions such as The Floral Harmony At Nanyang International Youth Floral Art Competition where they won Gold, Silver and 2 Merit awards in 2018. In addition, our students also participated in the yearly UOB Painting of the Year Competition and previous year&rsquo;s National Kidney Foundation Postcard Design Competitions. These competitions had further created a platform for them to create works of art that both inspired and challenged their creativity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The experiences that Art Club students go through will help them to build good leadership characteristics and moral values, strengthen their artistic dispositions while enjoying developing their aesthetic sense, appreciation of and passion for the various art forms.</p>

<p>Sec 3 ATDP Learn to Curate:&nbsp;<br />Students discussing their understanding and unpacking the stories behind an artwork.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, students from our Art Talent Development Programme participated in the Live On Festival (LOF) 2021 Design Competition. We are delighted to share that Destinee Chee Tong En of Class 3-6 has been awarded the Special Mention award for her artwork, "Brand New Beginnings".&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mixed media artwork is her interpretation of the experience of a person in need of an organ donation. She uses symbols to convey that experience - the hourglass and melting clock are reminders of how time is often not on the side of the sufferer, while the flowers and wings symbolise the hope, freedom and a new beginning that they long for. Through her work, she hopes to encourage others to become organ donors so that they may save lives and release sufferers from sadness and despair. Her message is simple: have a heart, donate a heart.</p>

<p>Despite the ongoing pandemic safety measures, the Floral Art Wing managed to have a fun and fruitful year. All the students participated in the Live On Festival 2021 Design Competition on organ donation, made interesting floral art and craft using recycled and repurposed materials through online and onsite workshops. The graduating students completed their CCA experience with their&nbsp; creation of a 'floating' floral art installation, entitled "Uncaged Beauty" for the NBSS Art Exhibition 2021.</p>

<p>As the world becomes more visual, there is a continued need for students to develop the skills needed to foster visual literacy; therefore, the goal of their artwork is to amplify the experiences throughout their cca to reflect their growth throughout the program.</p>
