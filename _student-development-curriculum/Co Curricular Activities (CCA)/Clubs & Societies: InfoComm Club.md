<p>In NBSS Infocomm Club, we strive to equip our students with info-communication skills in order to facilitate digital media production(s). Here, we focus on developing students&rsquo; skills in photography, videography, basic photo and video editing, basic programming and the management of the school&rsquo;s public announcement system.</p>
<p>Through active participation in school events, our students get to apply their photography, videography and editing skills. During CCA sessions, students learn programming through Swift Playground and Python, photo editing through Lightroom, and video editing through Da Vinci Resolve and iMovies. Our students also undergo PA training in teams, learning to navigate various audio-visual systems and supporting school events behind-the-scenes, ensuring the smooth-running of events.</p>
<p>The club also aims to cultivate leadership capabilities and forge strong friendships and a sense of camaraderie among members. The executive committee members are tasked to lead, plan training programmes and organise activities for the other members, ranging from weekly school assemblies, team-bonding sessions to farewell ceremonies.</p>
<p><u>Infocomm Club Framework</u></p>
<img src="/images/info1.jpg">
<p>Tier 1: All Infocomm Club members will undergo training in the aspects of photography, videography, basic photo and video editing, basic programming skills (Swift and Python) and audio-visual support. All students will also be required to upkeep an E-portfolio which documents their learning and achievements in Infocomm Club. As Infocomm Club members, students will also serve as Cyberwellness ambassadors to promote Cyber Wellness awareness within their peers and actively support Cyber Wellness programmes in our school.</p>
<p>Tier 2: Every Infocomm Club member will have the opportunity to be selected for various competitions of various aspects including and not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our Schools, Our Stories Photo Contest</li>
<li>Singapore Young Photographer award</li>
<li>N.E.mation</li>
<li>Ace of Coders</li>
<li>Youth Cyber Exploration Programme</li>
</ul>
<p>This serves to stretch performing students in the various disciplines, giving them the chance to gain substantial experience, showcase their skills, and uncover their personal aptitude in the process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tier 3: Infocomm Club members who have shown good leadership capabilities will be selected as the executive committee members where they are provided with opportunities to initiate, organise and implement programmes for their juniors and the school community. They will also be involved in the training of not only their juniors, but also the IT class representatives, in terms of audio-visual technical skills.&nbsp;</p>
