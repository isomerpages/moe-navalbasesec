<p><strong>CCA Descripton</strong></p>
<p>The Naval Base Basketball team was formed in 1995 and has since gone from strength to strength, making significant progress in both zonal and national competitions. It has produced outstanding national basketball players, such as Mr Hong Wei Jian, who played for the Singapore Slingers in the inaugural 2009/10 ASEAN Basketball League season.</p>
<p><strong>CCA Vision</strong></p>
<p>NBSS Basketball aims to promote the physical and socio-emotional development of students through a holistic and values-based system of training. We aim to use the principles of basketball as a vehicle for character growth, emphasising the values of teamwork and sportsmanship. Furthermore, rigorous training will foster the values of discipline, perseverance and excellence. Students are presented with opportunities to cultivate their leadership skills on and off the court. Players will take ownership of the team, assuming the responsibilities of team management and direction. They will also be presented with opportunities to plan, lead and execute programmes for their fellow CCA members. These programmes cover a range of relevant topics, from sports injuries and management to sports journalism and new media. NBSS Basketball serves as a platform for students to be exposed to a range of memorable and meaningful experiences. For example, one of the opportunities afforded to our players was the chance to meet the Singapore Slingers (National Basketball Players) in 2019, allowing them to gain valuable exposure to the character traits and values required to pursue their passions.&nbsp;</p>
