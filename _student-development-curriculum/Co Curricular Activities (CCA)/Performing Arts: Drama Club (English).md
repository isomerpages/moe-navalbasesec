<p>Drama is an opportunity for students to express themselves and build up good communication and public speaking skills. It creates an environment of fun and laughter in which friendships can be fostered and nurtured.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Naval Base Secondary School, students build their character through active participation in co-curricular activities such as the Drama Club. The Drama Club is dedicated to exploring different forms of stage art to express and hone the skills of each member. Drama Club members are involved in various aspects of a theatrical performance such as acting, scriptwriting, stage production, and lighting and sound management. This emphasises the indispensability of the entire crew, whether on stage or behind the scenes. Over time, students become empowered individuals who are ready to make a difference in whatever tasks they partake in.</p>
<p>In addition to being exposed to different roles and genres of drama, our members are encouraged to mentor their juniors and lead by example. They maintain a journal to document their learning and individual reflections about experiences and challenges after every training sessions and stage performances. Each year, the Drama Club provides opportunities for students to hone their skills by participating in national performance showcase such as the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (Drama).</p>
<p>The Drama Club also conducted our own virtual drama festival in 2021 where students were divided into groups of five and had to come up with a short skit on one of the SHIPSHAPE values that resonated with them. They spent a number of weeks meeting up through the Zoom platform, brainstorming for ideas, writing the script and actually planning and producing their own virtual zoom performance with costumes, props and virtual backgrounds included to make their performances pop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through these activities, our actors and crew are able to develop and showcase their skills, team-work and commitment to Drama Arts. This is continued even in term 3 of 2021 when were only able to have e-CCA. Each session started with student-led warm-ups, a Drama related skill taught by instructor and students applying the skills learnt through mini role-plays. Enriching and fruitful sessions indeed!</p>
