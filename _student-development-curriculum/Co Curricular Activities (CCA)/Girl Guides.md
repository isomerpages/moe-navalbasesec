<p>Girl Guides Singapore aims to develop girls and young women to their fullest potential as responsible citizens of the world. The Guiding programme teaches girls vital life skills &ndash; such as personal goal-setting, decision-making and team-building &ndash; in a safe and supportive environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Naval Base Secondary, the motto &lsquo;Once a Guide, Always a Guide.&rsquo;, carries the values as well as the rich experiences that our Guides take away with them. The myriad of activities we offer aims to ignite the guiding light in our students to help develop their self-awareness and self-management. This includes annual camps, proficiency badges, outdoor activities (e.g. camp craft, tent-pitching, outdoor cooking), leadership and skills training workshops and community work.</p>
<p>We also develop our Guides&rsquo; social awareness through meaningful service learning projects, such as choreographing an exercise video for the seniors at the Sree Narayana Mission Home. We build and strengthen our students&rsquo; leadership skills by providing them opportunities to plan and conduct division-level workshops, to lead in unit-wide and patrol-wide activities and to teach their fellow guides and brownies from other schools new skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our strong sense of commitment and pride has earned us the Puan Noor Aishah (PNA) Award (Gold). Numerous girls have also earned the prestigious Baden-Powell Award (BPA) over the past few years through their active participation in the CCA. We hope to inspire and empower every girl to maximise their potential and enable them to become future-ready leaders at the end of their Guiding journey.&nbsp;</p>
