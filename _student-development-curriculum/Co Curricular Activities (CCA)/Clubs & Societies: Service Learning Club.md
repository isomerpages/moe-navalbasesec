<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Library Club aims to instil in the members a love for books as well as equip them with skills necessary to promote reading among their peers in the school. Through the various activities within the CCA, the members will develop their leadership abilities and strengthen their communication skills.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The CCA has organised various activities&nbsp;related to reading and book promotion. Members learn the art of story-telling and have participated in the Queen&rsquo;s Commonwealth Essay Competition. They learn to shelf as well as select appropriate books for Book Buffet - where students visit the library to taste a selection of books to browse and borrow. Furthermore, they create short videos using their personal learning devices (PLDs) where they have to put to use their interview and presentation skills.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the library related activities, the members work on community projects to broaden their perspectives and learn the importance of social cohesion. They interviewed and filmed the school&rsquo;s service providers like the security personnel, canteen vendors and contract cleaners to understand their work and contribution to the school. They also participated in a video competition held by Lions Home for the Elders. Through these activities, they learn how to empathise with the less privileged people.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Library&nbsp;Club continues to work in its vision to instil a love for lifelong passion for reading&nbsp;among the&nbsp;NBSS students.</p>

<div>
<p>Four Library Club members (Priyanka Maurya d/o Ramesh C, Ong Xuan Rong and Vivian Hung Meng Yun from Hope 3-1, and Kesshini d/o Ramesh Kumar) competed in the Prove-It! competition organised by National Library Board.</p>
<p>In the fast-paced competition involving 63 teams from other schools, the Library Club members had to research the answers to thirty questions and use multiple sources to prove their answers within one hour.</p>
<p>The students held multiple practice sessions to hone their research skills and familiarise themselves with online databases, such as Grolier Online and World Geography Online, as well as the National Library catalogue system for print books. Their hard work and perseverance, as well as their enthusiasm and team spirit helped them to learn this wholly new skill and display their prowess.</p>
<p>They emerged 3rd place winners in the North Zone Regional Competition, entered the Finals held at the National Library and received Certificates of Merit for their efforts.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Library Club members!</p>
