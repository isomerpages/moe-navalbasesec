<p>NBSS St John Brigade Singapore (SJBS) aims to challenge our cadets to maximise their potential and become lifelong learners through showing mutual respect and working together as a team. In collaboration with the SJBS HQ, the unit offers the cadets with a variety of fun and challenging activities in developing cadets into leaders of character. Amidst the Covid-19 situation this year, we continued using online lessons to teach life skills such as first aid and home nursing to our cadets. Furthermore, we are proud that our two cadets, Sharyl Kwang and Ong Zi Qian, have been awarded the Chief Commissioner Badge, the most prestigious badge a cadet can obtain.</p>
<p>At Naval Base Secondary School, all SJB cadets have the experience of mentoring their juniors for a year, teaching life skills such as first aid and home nursing. Besides that, our cadets are also given the opportunity to organize the weekly training sessions. Cadet leaders are given multiple opportunities to organize and execute other activities as well. Through the planning and execution of the events, our cadet leaders learnt how to work together as a team and also the importance of effective communication.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, our sec 1 cadets took part in the joined collaboration with other uniformed groups to carry out plogging. Through these kinds of activities, we also hope that cadets in SJB will continue to maintain the standards set by their seniors and aim to achieve greater heights, as they seek to continue to live up to our motto &ldquo;For the service of mankind&rdquo;.</p>
