<p><strong>CCA Description</strong></p>
<p>Football is a game played with 11 players on each side with a goal at each end requiring great team work, perseverance and communication. Each character plays a significant role in determining its success.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CCA Vision</strong></p>
<p>In Naval Base Secondary School, we believe that character can be built through sports and thus focus on the process rather than the outcome. Hence, our teachers and coach work closely with our players to identify their strengths and areas for improvement. This is now undergirded through SHIPSHAPE &ndash; a values system unique to Naval Base Secondary. Players are given opportunities to reflect on past matches, analyse the current state of the team and decide how best to progress. The process left them hungrier for success and increased their desire to improve. Most of all, this has strengthened the team&rsquo;s camaraderie and shaped the character of our players.</p>
<p>With the guidance of a new coach and new teachers, the boys started off 2018 well. Our B boys did well in the qualifying round, making it to top two placing in the zonal competition. They then qualified to play in the Schools Premier League 2, before crashing out in the Quarter finals, which is a feat the school has not achieved in over a decade. It was a tough and long tournament and the boys gained valuable experience not only playing against schools from around the island, but also juggling their studies. Our C boys were motivated by the successes of their seniors and they tried their best in the zonal round.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through these activities, our football players will continue to strive to achieve for high standards and mature into leaders of character who are capable in leading their own teams.</p>
