<p>Table Tennis is an all-encompassing sport that combines one&rsquo;s aptitude of accuracy and strength with an attitude of patience and diligence. Effective playing skills are mastered over many hours of building foundational moves with attention-to-detail. Responsibility is also emphasized through the care of equipment such as the tables, balls and bats.</p>
<p>NBSS Table Tennis aims to instil resilience, determination, courage and diligence in our players. To do this, we take a holistic approach in developing every member. We have a comprehensive 4-year plan which includes signature programmes such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Orientation (Secondary 1)</li>
<li>Coaching course (Secondary 1)</li>
<li>Umpiring course (Secondary 2)</li>
<li>Mentoring opportunities (Secondary 3)</li>
<li>Advisory roles (Secondary 4 and 5)</li>
<li>Sports journalism&nbsp;</li>
<li>Sports photography</li>
<li>SHIPSHAPE Tournament (A friendly competition with four to five other schools organised by us)</li>

</ul>
<p>If you are determined to challenge your mental capacity and push past your physical capabilities, the NBSS Table Tennis team welcomes you with open arms. Do consider joining our family, and we will make your secondary school journey a fruitful and enjoyable one!</p>
