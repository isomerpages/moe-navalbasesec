<p>Cyber Wellness refers to the positive well-being of internet users. Cyber Wellness education aims to equip students with an understanding of online behaviour and enable them to be responsible for their own well-being in cyberspace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With schools placing greater emphasis on integrating technology into teaching and learning, it is necessary&nbsp;for students to examine the consequences of their online activities and behaviour. Schools take the lead&nbsp;in promoting digital and social media literacies. Both Cyber Wellness education and use of ICT for teaching&nbsp;and learning have to move in tandem. It is also important for schools to partner with parents in raising&nbsp;the awareness of developing positive digital citizens and future-ready learners.</p>
<p>3 principles of Cyber Wellness:</p>
<ul>
<li>Respect for self and others.</li>
<li>Safe and responsible use.</li>
<li>Positive peer influence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through CW lessons, your child will be taught to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sense&nbsp;&ndash; Identify possible online risks and protect themselves.</li>
<li>Think&nbsp;&ndash; Analyse, evaluate and reflect on a situation based on the CW principles.</li>
<li>Act&nbsp;&ndash; Take actions to keep safe and be a positive influence online.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from the Cyber Wellness curriculum that is taught during CCE lessons, there&nbsp;is also an annual Cyber Wellness day held in July, where Cyber Wellness Ambassadors will bring awareness&nbsp;of current issues to students.&nbsp;<br />Our Infocomm Club members, under the guidance of their teachers, will also share some relevant information during assembly to promote awareness of some Cyber Wellness topics and issues.&nbsp;</p>
