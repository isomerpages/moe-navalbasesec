<p>The school&rsquo;s ALP in Art provides art learning to all students throughout their 4 to 5 years in the school. Students are exposed to a wide range of art and design practices from four broad art disciplines; namely fine art, digital media, design and the critical study of art. The ALP in Art curriculum is delivered through the formal art curriculum and co-curriculum. The formal art curriculum comprises the General Art Programme (GAP) and Enhanced Art Programme (EAP) at lower and upper secondary levels respectively. Students on the EAP will offer Art at Normal (Technical), Normal (Academic) and Ordinary levels. The art co-curriculum comprises the Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) and enrichment and talent development programmes. The ALP in Art is part of a larger aesthetics programme, which also develops students in the areas of music and the performing arts.</p>
