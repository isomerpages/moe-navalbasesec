#### Centralised DSA-Sec Application Process

Application for DSA-Sec can be submitted through the online DSA-Sec Portal. The application is free-of-charge and will be open from 4 May 2023, 11am to 31 May 2023, 3pm. 

For our school, the specific timeline for 2023 is as follows:

| Action | Period/Date | 
| -------- | -------- | 
| Notification to applicants selected for interviews | 14 Jul 2023 (Fri)     | 
| Interview and Selection / Trial period | 17 Jul - 4 Aug 2023     | 
| Notification of DSA outcome | 24 Aug 2023 (Thu)     | 

We will endeavour to reach out to all applicants on the outcome of their applications. However, due to the high volume of applications, if you do not hear from us by the deadlines above, it is likely that your application is unsuccessful. Enquiries can be sent to nbss@moe.edu.sg.
