#### Centralised DSA-Sec Application Process

Application for DSA-Sec can be submitted through the online DSA-Sec Portal. The application is free-of-charge and will be open (Date TBC). 

For our school, the specific timeline for 2024 is as follows:

| Action | Period/Date | 
| -------- | -------- | 
| Notification to applicants selected for interviews | (TBC)    | 
| Interview and Selection / Trial period | (TBC)    | 
| Notification of DSA outcome | (TBC)     | 

We will endeavour to reach out to all applicants on the outcome of their applications. However, due to the high volume of applications, if you do not hear from us by the deadlines above, it is likely that your application is unsuccessful. Enquiries can be sent to nbss@moe.edu.sg.
