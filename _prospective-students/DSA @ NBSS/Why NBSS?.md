<p>All Secondary One Navalites admitted to our school via DSA will benefit
from customised talent development programmes to groom them to become leaders
in their respective talent areas. These programmes focus on fostering both
performance and moral character, aligning with our school's RECIPE values
of Respect, Resilience, Care, Integrity, Passion and Excellence. Students
will develop their leadership skills through the application of the five
practices of exemplary leadership modelling the way, inspiring a shared
vision, challenging the process, enabling others to act, and encouraging
the heart while actively participating in their CCAs and student development
initiatives.</p>
