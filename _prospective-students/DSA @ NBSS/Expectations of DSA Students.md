Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and
strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.

Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected to honour their commitment to the school, and participate in the activities related to the talent they are selected for throughout their secondary school life. 

<p>In addition to meeting the general academic promotion standards and modelling positive conduct and behaviour, students admitted to the school via the DSA-Sec Exercise are expected to:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;Commit to their CCA for the entire duration of their secondary school life;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;Participate actively in talent development programmes planned for them;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;Support the school in the planning, organisation and implementation of school-wide programmes related to their talent area;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;Act as ambassadors for the school during school events; and</p>
<p>·&nbsp;Represent the school in competitions and/or&nbsp;projects related to their talent area.</p>
<p>For Visual Art, DSA students are also encouraged to offer Art at upper secondary level so that they may continue to pursue it as an educational and career pathway in the future.</p>
