<p>In addition to meeting the general academic promotion standards and modelling
positive conduct and behaviour, students admitted to the school via the
DSA-Sec Exercise are expected to:
<br>·&nbsp;Commit to their CCA for the entire duration of their secondary
school life
<br>·&nbsp;Participate actively in talent development programmes planned for
them
<br>·&nbsp;Support the school in the planning, organisation and implementation
of school-wide programmes related to their talent area
<br>·&nbsp;Act as ambassadors for the school during school events; and
<br>·&nbsp;Represent the school in competitions and/or&nbsp;projects related
to their talent area.
<br>
<br>For Art, DSA students are also encouraged to offer Art at upper secondary
level so that they may continue to pursue it as an educational and career
pathway in the future.</p>
