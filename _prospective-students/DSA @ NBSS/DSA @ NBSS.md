<p>The Direct School Admission (DSA) Exercise is an admission exercise to
allow participating secondary schools to select some Primary 6 students
for admission to Secondary One based on their achievements and talents
before the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) results are released.
It seeks to promote holistic education and provide students with an opportunity
to demonstrate a more diverse range of achievements and talents in seeking
admission to a secondary school.</p>
<p>Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on
the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic
and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop
the area of talent.</p>

of Education website at <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/secondary/dsa" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.moe.gov.sg/secondary/dsa</a>.</p>
