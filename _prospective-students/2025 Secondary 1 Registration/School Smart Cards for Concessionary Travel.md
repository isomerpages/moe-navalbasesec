<p>While waiting for your childâ€™s Secondary level Student Smart Card (SSC) to be ready, he/she may continue to use his/her Primary level SSC for concessionary travel until further notice from MOE next year. Your child should purchase the Bus Concession Pass (BCP) for Secondary School students to enjoy concessionary travel.</p>
