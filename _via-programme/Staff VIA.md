<p>It was a meaningful Thursday afternoon on 4 April 2013, when 87 of our teaching and non-teaching staff volunteers picked up ukeleles, cans and rags for our staff Values In Action (VIA) activity at the Sree Narayana Home for the Aged Sick at Yishun Avenue 5. One team cleaned the wards&rsquo; windows, while another conducted a maracas-making session with 25 elderly residents.</p>
<p>Most staff felt it was a good opportunity to interact with the elderly and understand their needs.<br />Ms Filzah said, &ldquo;It was hard to communicate with the elderly residents at first&hellip;but once they opened up&hellip;their smiles and cheerfulness were contagious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Teachers Ms Nur Aishah and Mr Jason Chen would like to share this meaningful experience with their students so as to encourage their charges to volunteer for such VIA experience. Senior Teacher Mrs Koh Nah Nah, in retrospect, said, &ldquo;Treasure your family members. This experience reminds me that it is important that we remain active.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of the afternoon, our talented staff sang and danced to the rhythm of the maracas with our silver-haired friends. We raised $1320 from personal staff donations, which we presented to the Home for the purchase of necessities such as Nespray milk.</p>
<p>It was indeed a well-spent afternoon getting to know each other and members of our community deeper.</p><hr>
<h4><strong>A Day of Song, Sharing and Service @ Sree Narayana Home for the Aged Sick</strong></h4>
<p>It was a meaningful Friday afternoon on 20 April 2012, when 67 of our teaching and non-teaching staff volunteers picked up microphones, glue sticks and buckets for our staff service learning project at the Sree Narayana Home for the Aged Sick at Yishun Avenue 5.</p>
<p>One team cleaned the wards&rsquo; windows and fans, while another conducted an art collage session with 47 elderly residents. &ldquo;I am so glad we got to brighten the day for the elderly there,&rdquo; said Ms Aderine Hee, a Beginning Teacher. Another Beginning Teacher, Ms Wong Yang Hui and experienced teacher Mrs Rathna Raghesh thought it was a very meaningful endeavour. &ldquo;I feel good about being given the opportunity to bring cheer to our senior citizens,&rdquo; Mrs Raghesh added. Senior Teachers Ms Tang Kheng Choy and Mrs Anis Osman commented that it was a good eye-opener and platform to foster empathy among our staff amidst our busy schedules. Mdm Toh Lay Cheng agrees, adding, &ldquo;The experience has left me with the desire to do even more. I look forward to another opportunity to help brighten the day of those who have sacrificed so much for Singapore.</p>
<p>At the end of the afternoon, our talented staff staged a musical tribute to our silver-haired friends. We raised $1231 from personal staff donations, which we presented to the Home for the purchase of necessities such as Nespray milk.</p>
