<p>All Secondary One Navalites admitted to our school via DSA will benefit from customised talent development programmes to groom them to become leaders in their respective talent areas. They will develop both performance and moral character through the active use of SHIPSHAPE, our leadership development model adapted from John Wooden&rsquo;s Pyramid of Success, and inculcation of the&nbsp;<a href="/about-us/our-identity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">school&rsquo;score values</a>&nbsp;as they grow within their respective CCAs and student development programmes.</p>
