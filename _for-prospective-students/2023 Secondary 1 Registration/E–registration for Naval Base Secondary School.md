<p>After receiving your posting to Naval Base Secondary School (NBSS), you do not need to physically report to school as registration will be done online. You will receive a notification from us via Parents Gateway (PG) to complete the Secondary One registration. While you may be considering a transfer to another school, you are still required to acknowledge your posting to secure your place in NBSS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not have PG,&nbsp;you can download it on your mobile phone from the Apple App/Google Play Store. For FAQs, refer to <a href="https://pg.moe.edu.sg/faq">https://pg.moe.edu.sg/faq</a>.</p>
