<p><strong>Direct School Admission (DSA)</strong></p>
<p>The Direct School Admission (DSA) Exercise is an admission exercise to allow participating secondary schools to select some Primary 6 students for admission to Secondary One based on their achievements and talents before the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) results are released. It seeks to promote holistic education and provide students with an opportunity to demonstrate a more diverse range of achievements and talents in seeking admission to a secondary school.</p>
<p>Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student&rsquo;s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools&rsquo; academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.</p>
