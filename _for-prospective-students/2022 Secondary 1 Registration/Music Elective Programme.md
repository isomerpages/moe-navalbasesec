<p><strong>Application for Music Elective Programme </strong></p>
<p>Secondary 1 students who exhibit interest and passion for Music are eligible to apply to be emplaced on the Music Elective Programme (MEP) in an MEP centre. Please refer to the announcement on Parents&rsquo; Gateway for more information on the programme and application process.</p>
<p>Please note that as NBSS is an Enhanced Art Programme (EAP) school, as well as offers the ALP in Art, our students will enjoy richer and more comprehensive Art learning compared to students in most secondary schools. As such, NBSS students are not eligible to apply for the Art Elective Programme (AEP).</p>
