<p><strong>Attire</strong></p>
<p>The school uniform for lower secondary students is made up of a school shirt and short pants or skirts with black socks (above the ankle) and predominantly black shoes.</p>
<p>Students who are unable to purchase the school uniform or pending transfer may report in their primary school uniform.</p>
<p>Given the safe measure measures and compulsory wearing of masks, the school recognises that the comfort of our students and staff is important. As such, we are exercising flexibility in uniform-wearing. Until further notice, students may choose to dress in half-uniform (i.e. PE t-shirt with school trousers/skirt)&nbsp;and prescribed footwear.</p>
<p>The Secondary ONe level t-shirt will be issued to students by end January 2022.&nbsp;Please refer to the Navalite Handbook for more information.</p>
<p><strong>School Reporting Time</strong></p>
<p>Students will report directly to their classrooms by 7.20am.&nbsp;Students will be considered late if they are not in class by 7.30am.</p>
<p>Teachers and student leaders will be stationed at the school gates to welcome our new students and direct them to their classes. Due to safe management measures, parents are not allowed to enter the school premises.</p>
<p><strong>School Dismissal</strong></p>
<p>Students will be dismissed at 1.15pm.&nbsp;</p>
