<p><strong>Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) @ NBSS</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>What is SIL?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) provides Navalites with the opportunity
to become independent, passionate and lifelong learners. It is a dedicated
time during HBL for them to explore, design and execute projects tied to
their personal interests that extend their learning beyond the school curriculum.</p>
<p><strong>Why SIL?</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Cultivate a Passion for Lifelong Learning</strong> – Encourage
curiosity beyond subject syllabi and independent knowledge acquisition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nurture Independent and Enthusiastic Learners</strong> – Develop
skills and mindsets for self-directed learning aligned with personal interests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Encourage Exploration and Collaboration</strong> – Inspire students
to share their passions with the wider community in a collaborative learning
environment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How is SIL implemented @ NBSS?</strong>
</p>
<p>For each SIL session, Navalites document their journey on their chosen
topics of interest, progressing through the following stages:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Research</strong> – Gathering information on their chosen topic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Define &amp; Design</strong> – Outlining goals and planning their
project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Implementation</strong> – Executing their ideas in practice.</p>

<p><strong>A Celebration of Learning: Student-led Workshops</strong>
</p>
<p>Throughout the year, selected Navalites facilitated student-led workshops
on topics like perfumery, crochet, coding, clay trinkets, and terrarium-making.
As facilitators, they honed skills in public speaking, collaboration, and
problem-solving while fostering a dynamic peer-learning environment.</p>
