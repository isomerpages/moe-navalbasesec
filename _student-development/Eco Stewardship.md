<h3>Our National Imperative: Eco-Stewardship</h3>
<p>The Singapore Green Plan (SGP) 2030 is the national strategy aimed at
achieving a sustainable future for Singapore. One of its key directions
is to promote sustainable living which involves encouraging individuals
and communities to adopt eco-friendly practices and lifestyles.</p>
<p>By promoting sustainable living, Singapore aims to cultivate a generation
of environmentally conscious citizens who will continue to practice sustainable
behaviour and contribute to a greener future for Singapore.</p>
<p>Information on the Singapore Green Plan 2030 and MOE’s efforts to support
the initiatives can be found at the following links:</p>

<h4>Environmental Education at NBSS</h4>
<p>In line with the SGP 2030, the Eco-Stewardship Programme (ESP) is introduced
in schools. In NBSS, our aim is to develop all Navalites to be stewards
for the environment. This is done via the nationwide 4Cs approach - Curriculum,
Campus, Culture and Community, and in customising the programmes under
this broad umbrella, we hope to shape all Navalites to be advocates for
sustainable living.</p>

<p>Our ESP builds on current environmental efforts in our school through
the 4Cs – Curriculum, Campus, Culture and Community.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Within the <strong>curriculum</strong>, there has been a refresh and enhancement
to the teaching and learning of sustainability within various subjects,
particularly in the Humanities and Sciences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For our <strong>campus</strong>, we are looking into exciting ways of enhancing
our infrastructure with sustainability features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In building an environmentally-friendly <strong>culture</strong>, our students
are encouraged and taught how to adopt various sustainability habits, which
include recycling, reducing energy use and reducing food waste.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As responsible members and future leaders of our <strong>community</strong>,
we leverage different opportunities to partner with various stakeholders
to expand environment related volunteering and enrichment opportunities
for our students.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through these efforts, the school envisions all Navalites to be advocates
for sustainable living in support of the Singapore Green Plan 2030. Navalites
will spearhead the necessary changes in living habits through being aware
of environmental issues, participate actively in environmental efforts,
lead others in issues of environmental concern and sustain these environmental
efforts for future generations of Navalites as well as themselves, and
the community they are situated in.</p>
<h3>Student Leaders: Eco-Councillors and Eco-Ambassadors</h3>
<h5>Eco-Councillors</h5>
<p>A key driver in driving environmental changes is to develop a core group
of students who demonstrate passion and dedication for environmental efforts.
This is the key goal for our student leaders known as the <strong>NBSS Eco-Councillors</strong>.</p>
<p>As one of the five Boards within the school’s Student Leadership Model,
the Eco-Board Councillors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pledge to be proactive role models of environment practices and sustainable
habits,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demonstrate keen interests and passion for environment project,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rally peers for environment causes, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engage partners for environmental causes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To develop our student leaders in environment-related competencies, necessary
training and exposure opportunities are provided to strengthen their capacity
to influence change. This includes various training opportunities held
by relevant ministries and agencies, as well as competitions and workshop
organised by other schools. The Eco-Councillors are also tasked to initiate
projects and lead efforts in NBSS to raise awareness among the school’s
population as well as contribute actively to the country’s environmental
goals.</p>
<p>Some of the developmental opportunities for the students in 2023 include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Project E.C.O Workshops by NEA to guide students in planning, organising,
implementing and monitoring environment projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>National Youth Upcycling Movement (Workshops and Competition) to equip
students with knowledge on organising environmental campaigns</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>National Youth Environment Conference (Model United Nations format) for
students to interact with like-minded students from other schools to discuss
environmental issues</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Green Seeker programmes organised by Gardens by the Bay to equip students
with knowledge on sustainable living</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plastic League organised by NEA for the students to have the chance to
organise school-wide environment campaigns</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Opportunities are also available within the school as the Eco-Councillors
are regularly tasked with sharing with the school on environment-related
news, suggestions and call for actions. This takes the form of school-wide
assembly sharing, planning for in-class activities on special occasions,
and plans to make school programmes more “green” with ideas for sustainable
practices -- you'll be surprised at how adept our students are at properly
preparing waste materials for recycling!</p>
<h5>Eco-Ambassadors</h5>
<p>Eco-Councillors, as our apex student leaders who lead the school in environmental
causes, are supported by the class environment leaders, the class Eco-Ambassadors.</p>
<p>The Eco-Ambassadors are a budding group of class leaders who directly
rally their classmates to take actions for environmental causes. This includes
helping to implement programmes at the class level, sharing of environmental
issues and representing classes for environmental causes.</p>
<p>Examples will include the sharing of Earth Day Messages in class, as well
as taking care of and encouraging plastic recycling/upcycling at the class
level, and monitoring the class’ recycling corners.</p>
<p>Evidently, students are our key focus as we seek to influence change by
providing our Eco-Councilors and Eco-Ambassadors the necessary knowhow
to effect change among the wider student population.</p>
<h3>Key Programme: Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW) -- For Every Secondary 2 Cohort</h3>
<p>Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW) is a key programme among our entire
Secondary 2 cohort, as a means of driving environmental education in our
school.</p>
<p>In itself, IPW aims to develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and
collaboration skills among secondary school students. As a yearly programme
which is carried out over a period of several months, students conduct
research, plan, execute their project and present their findings to their
peers and teachers. They are also given the opportunities to present their
prototypes and campaigns as part of recess exhibitions in our school.</p>
<p>In NBSS, the IPW project challenges students to work together on a project
that addresses an environmental issue in our school. By bringing together
different disciplines, the students learn to approach environmental problems
from multiple perspectives, and have the opportunity to bring together
project management skills in a way that contributes to our school's eco-stewardship
efforts.</p>

<h3>Our Key Programmes (2023)</h3>
<p>With the help of our Eco-Board Councilors and Eco Ambassadors, the school
organises environmental events to enrich Navalites’ learning experiences.</p>
<h5>Earth Week</h5>
<p>Earth Day is an annual global event to promote environmental awareness
and encourage action to protect the planet. Our school celebrates it by
organising a range of activities that promote environmental awareness and
action. These activities include assembly talks, in-class activities and
Earth Hour, where the lights and fans are switched off for an hour. In
class, the Eco-ambassadors are given the task to carry out talks on the
use of plastics, and ways to reduce plastic use. They were also encouraged
to wear green-coloured shirts to commemorate the day. Beyond that, they
also guide their classmates on how to calculate their plastic footprint.
This serves to raise awareness on the amount of plastic usage among the
students.</p>

</div>
<h5>Plastic League Recycling Competition</h5>
<p>Our school takes part in the Plastic Recycling League – a recycling competition
organised by SembEnviro. Each class was tasked to create a recycling corner
in their classrooms, and our students have been taught on the appropriate
materials which can be recycled.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/envedu3.png">
</div>
<h5>International Biodiversity Week</h5>
<p>International Biodiversity Week is an annual event celebrated worldwide
to raise awareness of the importance of biodiversity conservation and its
threats. In celebrating this week, our school participates in Bio Blitz,
an educational programme conducted by the National Parks Board. This programme
involves a series of hands-on activities that allow students to explore
and document the flora and fauna in their school environment.</p>
<p>We conducted this programme for all Secondary 2 students, and representatives
from the school’s Parent Support Group were also invited to join us in
learning about and appreciating the biodiversity in our school.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/envedu4.png">
</div>
<h5>Wildlife Smuggling Sharing by NParks</h5>
<p>In connection with International Biodiversity Week, we invited a speaker
from NParks to share with Navalites about the issue of wildlife smuggling
in Singapore. This is an important and interesting issue that the country
has been clamping down on for a while and broadens Navalites’ understanding
of wildlife issues in Singapore. The sharing also provides insights on
possible career opportunities in the related fields and was well-received
by the students and teachers.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/envedu5.png">
</div>
<h5>National Youth Environment Conference (Model United Nations at Nan Hua High School)</h5>
<p>Selected Eco-Councillors participated in the National Youth Environment
Conference (NYEC) held at Nan Hua High School. The NYEC takes on the Model
United Nations Conference format which allows students to put themselves
in the shoes of world leaders and tackle current environmental issues together.
It provides a great opportunity for students to better understand the environmental
issues at international level and the complexities of these issues, while
also developing their communication and collaborative skills as they worked
with delegates from other schools to reach consensus for the issues being
discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Workshops and Training for our students</strong>
</p>
<p>To support the acquiring of knowledge related to sustainability, students
also have the chance to participate in training workshops that touch on
various pillars related to the Singapore Green Plan 2030. From BioGirl
MJ’s workshop on recycled paper workshop to vermicomposting sessions, and
programmes organised by Gardens by the Bay, the schools strives to provide
our students with opportunities to learn about and witness sustainability
efforts through various channels.</p>
