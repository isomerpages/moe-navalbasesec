### Our National Imperative: Eco-Stewardship

The Singapore Green Plan (SGP) 2030 is the national strategy aimed at achieving a sustainable future for Singapore. One of its key directions is to promote sustainable living which involves encouraging individuals and communities to adopt eco-friendly practices and lifestyles. By promoting sustainable living, Singapore aims to cultivate a generation of environmentally conscious citizens who will continue to practice sustainable behaviour and contribute to a greener future for Singapore. Information on the Singapore Green Plan 2030 and MOE’s efforts to support the initiatives can be found at the following links:

### Environmental Education at NBSS

In line with the SGP 2030, the Eco-Stewardship Programme (ESP) is introduced in schools with the aim to develop all Navalites to be stewards for the environment. This is done with the official 4Cs approach - Curriculum, Campus, Culture and Community – to shape all Navalites to be advocates for sustainable living.

The ESP builds on current environmental efforts in our school through the 4Cs – Curriculum, Campus, Culture and Community. Within curriculum, there has been a refresh and enhancement to the teaching and learning of sustainability within various subjects such as Humanities and Sciences. For campus, we are looking into ways of enhancing our infrastructures with sustainability features. In building a budding environmental-friendly culture, our students are encouraged to adopt various sustainability habits which include recycling, reducing energy use and food waste. Within the community purview, we leveraged different opportunities to partner with various stakeholders to expand environment related volunteering and enrichment opportunities for our students. By participating in the Eco-Stewardship Programme, students develop a sense of environmental responsibility and become active stewards of the planet.   

Through these effort, the school envisions all Navalites to be advocates for sustainable living in support of the Singapore Green Plan 2030. Navalites will spearhead the necessary changes in living habits through being aware of environment issues, participate actively in environmental efforts, lead others in issues of environmental concern and sustain these environmental efforts for future generations of Navalites as well as the enthusiasm for themselves and the community they are situated in.

### Student Leaders: Eco-Councillors and Eco-Ambassadors

A key driver in driving environmental changes is to develop a core group of students who demonstrate passion and dedication for environment efforts. This is the key goal for our student leaders known as the NBSS Eco-Councilors.  

As one of the five boards in the school’s Student Leadership Model, the Eco-Board Councilors will:

*   Pledge to be proactive role models of environment practices and sustainable habits,  
    
*   Demonstrate keen interests and passion for environment project, 
    
*   Rally peers for environment causes, and  
    
*   Engage partners for environmental causes. 
    
To develop our student leaders in environment-related competencies, necessary training and exposure opportunities are provided to strengthen their capacity to influence change. This includes various training opportunities held by relevant ministries and agencies, as well as competitions and workshop organised by other schools. The Eco-Councilors are also tasked to initiate projects and lead efforts in NBSS to raise awareness among the school’s population as well as contribute actively to the country’s environmental goals. Some of the developmental opportunities for the students in 2023 include: 

1.  Project E.C.O Workshops by NEA to guide students in planning, organising, implementing and monitoring environment projects.  
2.  National Youth Upcycling Movement (Workshops and Competition) to equip students with knowledge on organising environmental campaigns
3.  National Youth Environment Conference (Model United Nations format) for students to interact with like-minded students from other schools to discuss environmental issues
4.  Green Seeker programmes organised by Gardens by the Bay to equip students with knowledge on sustainable living 
5.  Plastic League organised by NEA for the students to have the chance to organise school-wide environment campaigns 

Opportunities are also available within the school as the Eco-Councilors are regularly tasked with sharing with the school on environment-related news, suggestions and call for actions. This takes the form of school-wide assembly sharing, planning for in-class activities on special occasions and plans to make school programmes more “green” with ideas for sustainable practices.  

Eco-Councilors are our student leaders who leads the school in environment causes and they are supported by the class environment leaders, the class Eco-Ambassadors. The Eco-Ambassadors are a budding group of class leaders who could directly rally their classmates to take actions for environment causes. This includes helping to implement programmes at the class level, sharing of environment issues and representing classes for environment causes. Examples will include sharing of Earth Day Messages in class, as well as taking care and encouraging plastic recycling/upcycling at the class level, and monitoring the class’ recycling corners.  

As such, students are our key focus as we seek to influence change by providing our eco-councilors and eco-ambassadors the necessary know how to effect changes among the wider student population.

### Key Programme: Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW) for All Sec 2 Navalites

Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW) is a key programme among the Secondary 2 students as a means of driving environmental education in our school. IPW aims to develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration skills among secondary school students. The project involves students working together on a project that addresses an environmental issue in our school. By bringing together different disciplines, the students learn to approach problems from multiple perspectives. IPW, a yearly programme which is carried out over a period of several months, during when students conduct research, plan, execute their project and present their findings to their peers and teachers. They are also given the opportunities to present their prototypes and campaigns as part of recess exhibitions in our school.

### Our Key Programmes (2023)

With the help of our Eco-Board Councilors and Eco Ambassadors, the school organises environmental events to enrich Navalites’ learning experiences.  

##### Earth Week

Earth Day is an annual global event to promote environmental awareness and encourage action to protect the planet. Our school celebrates it by organizing a range of activities that promote environmental awareness and action. These activities include assembly talks, in class activities and Earth Hour where the lights and fans are switched off for an hour. In class, the eco\-ambassadors are given the task to carry out talks on the use of plastics, and ways to reduce plastic use. They were also encouraged to wear green colored shirts to commemorate the day. Beyond that, they also guide their classmates on how to calculate their plastic footprint. This serves to raise awareness on the amount of plastic usage among the students.

##### Plastic League Recycling Competition  

Our school takes part in the Plastic Recycling League – a recycling competition organised by SembEnviro. Each class was tasked to create a recycling corner in their classrooms, and our students have been taught on the appropriate materials which can be recycled.

##### International Biodiversity Week 

International Biodiversity Week is an annual event celebrated worldwide to raise awareness of the importance of biodiversity conservation and its threats. In celebrating this week, our school participates in Bio Blitz, an educational programme conducted by the National Parks Board. This programme involves a series of hands-on activities that allow students to explore and document the flora and fauna in their school environment. 

We conducted this programme for all Secondary 2 students, and representatives from the school’s Parent Support Group were also invited to join us in learning about and appreciating the biodiversity in our school.

##### Wildlife Smuggling Sharing by NParks 

In connection with International Biodiversity Week, we invited a speaker from NParks to share with Navalites about the issue of wildlife smuggling in Singapore. This is an important and interesting issue that the country has been clamping down on for a while and broadens Navalites’ understanding of wildlife issues in Singapore. The sharing also provides insights on possible career opportunities in the related fields and was well-received by the students and teachers.
