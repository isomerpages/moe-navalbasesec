<p>Our Secondary 1 Navalites began their journey with Camp Victory, a 3-day,
2-night residential camp at CSC Changi. As their first major school adventure,
it offered the perfect opportunity to step out of their comfort zones,
build resilience, and form lasting friendships.</p>
<p>Through outdoor activities like cycling, kayaking, orienteering, outdoor
cooking, and team games, students learned the value of teamwork, perseverance,
and trust. A highlight was the campfire on the final night, where the cohort
bonded through songs, performances, and celebration.</p>
<p>With enthusiasm and mutual support, Navalites embraced every challenge,
returning home with new skills, cherished memories, and a stronger sense
of camaraderie.</p>
