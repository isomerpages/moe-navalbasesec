<p>Values in Action (VIA) are learning experiences that support students’
development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully
to the community through the learning and application of values, knowledge
and skills.</p>
<p>In our school, we believe in greater ownership of our students in their
VIA learning experiences because students will find VIA more meaningful
and be more motivated to continue making a difference to the community
and nation.</p>
<p>In line with the school’s mission and vision of nurturing every student
to achieve personal mastery and to impact others positively, Naval Base
Secondary School has designed a Values in action (VIA) programme which
allows our students to exercise social responsibility and play their part
through meaningful contribution to the community.</p>
