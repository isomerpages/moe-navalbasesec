<p><strong>Citizenship Education@NBSS</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;At NBSS, we strive to develop in our students a deep understanding
and appreciation of Singapore and citizenship in today's complex world.
Through engaging learning experiences, we nurture important citizenship
dispositions where students explore and examine their identity as citizens
in relation to society and the world, and arrive at our shared ideals and
values.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Our Citizenship Dispositions</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>A Sense of Belonging</strong>
<br>We help our students develop a deeper understanding of who we are as Singaporeans,
and a shared understanding of the values that are important to us as a
nation.</p>
<p><strong>A Sense of Hope</strong>
<br>Our programmes cultivate confidence and optimism in Singapore's future,
building resilience in our students to face the challenges ahead.</p>
<p><strong>A Sense of Reality</strong>
<br>Students gain awareness of contemporary realities – including Singapore's
constraints and vulnerabilities – which affect us as a nation amidst the
backdrop of a less predictable world.</p>
<p><strong>The Will to Act</strong>
<br>We empower our students to be active citizens who have a collective resolve
and a sense of shared mission towards building a Singapore for all.</p>
