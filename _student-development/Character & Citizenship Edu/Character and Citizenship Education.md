<p>CCE is central to the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Century Competencies Framework. It emphasises the interconnectedness of the core values, social and emotional competencies and civic literacy, global awareness and cross-cultural skills that are critical for character and citizenship development of our students.</p>
<p><strong><u>CCE programme</u></strong></p>
<p>Naval Base Secondary School’s vision of&nbsp;‘Leaders of Character, School of Excellence’ stems from its belief that character development is key towards the holistic development of its students. Anchored on the school’s values of ExC<sup>2</sup>ITe (Excellence, Care, Courage, Integrity, Teamwork), our CCE programme aims to develop character and cultivate leadership among our students through our 3 key enablers , Values in Action (VIA) , Citizenship Education (CE) and Student Leadership Development (SLD).</p>
<p>In addition to these enablers, our CCE programme also consist of Guidance Modules which have specific objectives and content which addresses issues associated with adolescent development such as Sexuality Education (SEd), Cyber Wellness (CW) and Career Guidance (ECG).&nbsp;</p>
