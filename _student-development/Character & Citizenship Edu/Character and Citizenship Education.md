<p><strong>Student Development @ NBSS</strong>
</p>
<p>At NBSS, we believe that every Navalite can become a Leader of Self and
Leader of Others. Our beliefs and approaches to developing our Navalities
are articulated in our Student Development Framework.

<p>Our RECIPE values form the core of our philosophy of student development,
focusing on developing Navalites’ 21st Century Competencies, Social-Emotional
Competencies and growth mindset, while ensuring their cognitive, social,
psychological, and physical well-being. Student development is facilitated
through various key enablers and approaches, catering to students’ needs
and profiles through a 4E approach (Embrace, Enrich, Engage, Excel), fostering
a caring and enabling school culture, and through enacting a Student Development
curriculum centred on CCE, CCA, Student Leadership, and Guidance.
<br>
<br><strong>CCE @ NBSS</strong>
<br>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is central to the holistic development
of our Navalites, shaping them into Leaders of Character and Learners of
Tomorrow. Through content areas such as Mental Health, National Education,
and Education and Career Guidance, we are dedicated to nurture Navalites
with good character, social-emotional well-being, a growth mindset, and
a commitment to active citizenship.</p>
<p></p>
<p>CCE is enacted through multiple platforms:</p>

<p>CCE is central to the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Century Competencies Framework.
It emphasises the interconnectedness of the core values, social and emotional
competencies and civic literacy, global awareness and cross-cultural skills
that are critical for character and citizenship development of our students.</p>
<p><strong><u>CCE programme</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Naval Base Secondary School’s vision of&nbsp;‘Leaders of Character, School
of Excellence’ stems from its belief that character development is key
towards the holistic development of its students. Anchored on the school’s
values of ExC<sup>2</sup>ITe (Excellence, Care, Courage, Integrity, Teamwork),
our CCE programme aims to develop character and cultivate leadership among
our students through our 3 key enablers , Values in Action (VIA) , Citizenship
Education (CE) and Student Leadership Development (SLD).</p>
<p>In addition to these enablers, our CCE programme also consist of Guidance
Modules which have specific objectives and content which addresses issues
associated with adolescent development such as Sexuality Education (SEd),
Cyber Wellness (CW) and Career Guidance (ECG).&nbsp;</p>
