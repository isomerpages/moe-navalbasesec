<p><strong>Student Development @ NBSS</strong>
</p>
<p>At NBSS, we believe that every Navalite can become a Leader of Self and
Leader of Others. Our beliefs and approaches to developing our Navalities
are articulated in our Student Development Framework.

<p>Our RECIPE values form the core of our philosophy of student development,
focusing on developing Navalites’ 21st Century Competencies, Social-Emotional
Competencies and growth mindset, while ensuring their cognitive, social,
psychological, and physical well-being. Student development is facilitated
through various key enablers and approaches, catering to students’ needs
and profiles through a 4E approach (Embrace, Enrich, Engage, Excel), fostering
a caring and enabling school culture, and through enacting a Student Development
curriculum centred on CCE, CCA, Student Leadership, and Guidance.
<br>
<br><strong>CCE @ NBSS</strong>
<br>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is central to the holistic development
of our Navalites, shaping them into Leaders of Character and Learners of
Tomorrow. Through content areas such as Mental Health, National Education,
and Education and Career Guidance, we are dedicated to nurture Navalites
with good character, social-emotional well-being, a growth mindset, and
a commitment to active citizenship.</p>
<p></p>
<p>CCE is enacted through multiple platforms:</p>
