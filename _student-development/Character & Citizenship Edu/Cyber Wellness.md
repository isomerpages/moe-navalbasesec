<p>Cyber Wellness refers to the positive well-being of internet users. Cyber
Wellness education aims to equip students with an understanding of online
behaviour and enable them to be responsible for their own well-being in
cyberspace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With schools placing greater emphasis on integrating technology into teaching
and learning, it is necessary&nbsp;for students to examine the consequences
of their online activities and behaviour. Schools take the lead&nbsp;in
promoting digital and social media literacies. Both Cyber Wellness education
and use of ICT for teaching&nbsp;and learning have to move in tandem. It
is also important for schools to partner with parents in raising&nbsp;the
awareness of developing positive digital citizens and future-ready learners.</p>
