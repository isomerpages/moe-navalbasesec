<p>Education and Career Guidance (ECG) helps Navalites develop a sense of
purpose in life. By nurturing self-awareness and self-directedness for
lifelong learning, ECG helps them develop a growth mindset, adaptability
and a resilient attitude to embrace future opportunities and appreciate
the value of all occupations.

<p>At NBSS, we provide Navalites with opportunities for:</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Self-discovery, where Navalites
nurture self-awareness to discover how they can meaningfully play a part
in their community;</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exploration of opportunities, where
Navalites become self-directed and confident to explore and leverage education
and career opportunities;</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preparation for the future, where
Navalites stay relevant, adaptable, and resilient through embracing the
need for lifelong learning.
<br>
<br>In lower secondary, Navalites begin their ECG journey by understanding
their personality, work values, interests and learning styles better. In
upper secondary, Navalites focus on exploring industry opportunities and
making informed decisions about their post-secondary pathways.

<p>Education and Career Guidance (ECG) serves as a vehicle for students to
develop their social and emotional competencies in all the 5 domains of
SEL For example, as&nbsp;students go through lessons and activities to
determine their personal strengths, interests and values, they develop
greater self awareness&nbsp;and more accurate self-perception.</p>
<p>Using the ECG development and delivery model as a guide, our school has
developed an ECG programme that is customised to meet our students’ needs.
For example, the learning journeys that we planned are target specific
with consideration to the subjects taken by our Sec 3 classes. Leveraging
on our strong partnership network, we have been able to organise cohort-level
activities and target-specific level activities successfully.</p>
