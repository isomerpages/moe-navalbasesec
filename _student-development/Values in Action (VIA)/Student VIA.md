<p><strong>Secondary 3 VIA</strong></p>
<p>As a part of their VIA programme (Project Active Ageing), Secondary 3 Navalites planned a series of fun yet educational experiences for the elderly from TOUCH senior activity centre. Apart from getting an opportunity to initiate positive changes in their community, the students also learnt project management skills.</p>
<p>Since the conception of this project, they have taught and spent time with the elderly doing activities such as Tote bag design, Decoupage, Key chain making, Crepe flower making, mooncake-making and Paper Origami.</p>
<p><strong>Secondary 2 VIA</strong></p>
<p>Our Secondary 2NA and 2NT students were Energy Conservation Ambassadors for the Reduce @ NorthWest programme under NorthWest CDC. Since 2014, NorthWest CDC has been conducting training for Navalites, after which they would knock on the doors of the residents of our neighbourhood to share the message and raise awareness of energy conservation. It was a fruitful afternoon as Navalites learnt how to communicate with the public, as well as interact with members of the community.</p>
<p>The school&rsquo;s VIA Programme for Secondary 2E students aims for students to develop and foster civic responsibility at school, understand and apply elements of Science (physical needs of plants, decomposition), Art (landscaping) and FCE (plant parts in cooking), appreciate greenery in their school environment and in Singapore and work and nurture as a team and class. In tending to the green spaces in school, our students would understand the importance of maintaining our green spaces to balance our urbanization.</p>
<p><strong>Secondary 1 VIA</strong></p>
<p>The school's VIA programme for Sec 1 aims for our students to develop an attitude of care towards their environment through their 3Rs effort with their family members. Each student will receive a 3Rs champion card in which they have to complete tasks listed with their family. This programme also hopes to provide an avenue for students to strengthen their relationships with their family members through doing so.</p>
