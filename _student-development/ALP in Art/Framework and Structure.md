<p><strong>Pervasive Track (Embrace)</strong>
</p>
<p>This foundational track is designed for all students, using inquiry-based
learning to nurture essential art knowledge and skills while developing
creative thinking and problem-solving abilities. Students learn to appreciate
art and culture while applying artistic habits of mind to other subjects
and daily life. Through school-wide art activities and exhibitions, they
gain confidence in artistic expression and develop a broader understanding
of art's role in society.</p>
