<h3><strong>Applied Learning Programme in Art: Nurturing Creative Minds</strong></h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>At the heart of our Art Learning Programme lies a commitment to creating
an immersive and dynamic artistic environment that sparks creativity and
nurtures expression. This approach is rooted in our belief in the transformative
power of art and its ability to expand students' perceptions of the world
around them, fostering self-discovery and expression.</p>
<p>As students engage in art-making, they develop complex reasoning processes
- <strong>comparing, organising, making decisions, investigating, questioning and problem-solving.</strong> Through
their artistic journey, they come to understand art's vital connections
to creative and mainstream industries, recognising how it permeates our
everyday lives and contributes to Singapore's vibrant cultural landscape.</p>
