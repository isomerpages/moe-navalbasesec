<p>When the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) was introduced, our school
chose to focus on physical education and sports. These activities play
a vital role in students' physical development and well-being, while also
serving as a key platform for character education.</p>
<p><strong>Our LLP is anchored in the belief that:</strong>
</p>
<p>Character, including Enhanced 21st Century Competencies (e21CC) and values,
can be taught and nurtured through sports and physical activities.</p>
<p>Active participation in sports and physical activities cultivates healthy
living dispositions and important life skills that prepare students for
success and purpose in life.</p>
<p>With these beliefs in mind, our school has enhanced its sports and physical
activities programme through a structured three-tiered approach: Embrace,
Enrich, and Excel. This approach enables us to nurture character in our
students through sports in a systematic and differentiated way.</p>
<p>Each tier targets different groups of students, allowing us to tailor
character development strategies to their specific needs and levels of
engagement. As students progress through the tiers, they take on greater
involvement and responsibility in sports, ensuring that their character
development grows alongside their sporting journey.</p>
