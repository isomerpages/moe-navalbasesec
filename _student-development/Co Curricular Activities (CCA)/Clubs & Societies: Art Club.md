<p>Our Art Club offers three distinctive wings that cater to different artistic
interests and talents:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Digital Creators (all art club members)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sculpture Studio (all art club members)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Art Talent Development Programme (DSA &amp; selected students)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Students explore two wings in their initial years before specialising
in their chosen area from Secondary 3 onwards. These enriching experiences
develop strong leadership qualities and sound moral values while refining
their artistic sensibilities. The journey cultivates a deep appreciation
for various art forms and nurtures a lasting passion for creative expression,
preparing them to be confident artists and creative thinkers.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Art Talent Development Programme (ATDP)</h4>
<p>This programme comprises DSA students and talented artists chosen through
portfolio submissions and interviews. ATDP members have access to dedicated
studio spaces where they can develop their artistic practice. Through exposure
to artist talks, museum visits, and workshops, students gain insights into
different art practices while working on meaningful projects that benefit
both school and community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of their key experiences include participating in the Singapore Youth
Festival Art Exhibition, curating the annual Naval Base Secondary School
Art Exhibition, and attending the Learn to Curate Programme with National
Gallery Singapore, where they learn to create meaningful audience experiences,
thoughtfully curate spaces, and effectively communicate artistic ideas
to the public.</p>

<p><em>“During my years at NBSS, I experienced unwavering support for my artistic pursuits. My passion for creative expression through art found a nurturing home here. The encouraging environment and meaningful connections I made throughout my school years helped me feel accepted and understood. Since then, i knew all i wanted to do was become an artist!”&nbsp;</em>

<p><em>“NBSS was where my love for art first took shape. Being in an environment that encouraged creativity helped me discover a passion I didn’t know I had. But what truly inspired me were the incredible teachers, Mrs Osman and Mrs Koh. Their passion, encouragement, and belief in me gave me the confidence to pursue art. They made a lasting impact on my life, and because of them, I found my purpose to become an art teacher and pass on that same inspiration to others. I graduated from Lasalle College of the Arts with a BA in Fine Arts. Currently an art teacher, dedicated to inspiring and nurturing the next generation just as my teachers once did for me!”</em>
