<p>The Drama Club provides students with opportunities to explore theatrical
arts and express their creativity through acting, directing, scriptwriting,
and stagecraft. They learn essential theatre skills such as voice projection,
movement, stage presence, script interpretation, and improvisation, alongside
stage management techniques including lighting, sound, props, and costume
design.</p>
<p>Over 4 to 5 years, students grow into confident communicators—able to
express ideas clearly, manage group dynamics under pressure, and develop
empathy by portraying diverse characters and understanding audience perspectives.</p>
