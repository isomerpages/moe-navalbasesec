<p>Girl Guides provides opportunities for girls to discover and develop their
strengths, their skills and their fullest potential, to become responsible
citizens of the world.&nbsp;We empower girls and women through fun and
challenging programmes, and unique experiences, adventures and activities.
We offer opportunities for girls to get involved in local and international
communities, equipping them to make a lasting positive impact by helping
others.</p>
<h4>What We Do</h4>
<p><strong>Training Sessions:</strong> Once a week on Tuesdays, a comprehensive
5-Point Programme enables Girl Guides to develop in 5 areas: Personal &amp;
Social Development, Home, Outdoor, Community and International. The Guiding
programme teaches girls vital skills – such as personal goal-setting, decision-making
and team-building – in a safe and supportive environment.</p>
<p><strong>Competitions/Performances:</strong> The Baden-Powell Award is a
competition for Girl Guides to demonstrate leadership qualities and proficiency
in programme planning. Girl Guides also participates in a variety of division-level
and headquarters-level events such as the North Division Fest and the School
Cookie Project.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Workshops &amp; Learning Opportunities:</strong> The Guides are
exposed to various learning opportunities and workshops such as the Sree
Narayana Mission Home Service Learning, Free Being Me Training, Gardens
by the Bay Ambassador Programme, Patrol Leaders' Training Camp and WAGGGS
Leadership Model Workshop.</p>
<p><strong>Camps &amp; Bonding Activities:</strong> The Guides attend at least
two camps a year: the Combined UG Camp and the Annual Guides Camp. They
may also get the opportunity to attend headquarters-run camps such as the
President’s Guide Award Test Camp. Guides also also experience a variety
of bonding activities such the inter-CCA games, Handknit Bag Weaving and
Flower Garland Making Workshop.</p>
