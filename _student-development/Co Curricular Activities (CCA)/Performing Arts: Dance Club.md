<p>The objective of Dance Club is to nurture a group of enthusiastic dancers who will be exposed to different dance forms through collaboration with external agencies and community organizations. The two main genres of dance practised are Hip Hop and Indian Dance. However, students are also exposed to various other genres such as multi-ethnic dance, street jazz and contemporary dance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dance club provides many opportunities for our dancers to participate in public arts events and performances. Members are also trained to take part in various competitions. The club also focuses on promoting cross-cultural understanding, developing the character of its members through values education and improving leadership qualities, through the various activities.</p>
<p>2021 has been a very special and memorable year as it was the much awaited SYF presentation year for secondary schools. Despite the uncertainties and the late start, the students worked relentlessly to do give their personal best. All the hard work paid off when the Indian Dance clinched the Certificate of Distinction and the International Dance clinched the Certificate of Accomplishment.</p>
<p>Beyond school, it was a proud moment when 10 students from Base Crew represented the school in this year’s national day parade and danced to the 2021 NDP theme song entitled The Road Ahead. The dance also partly featured the students’ own choreography.</p>

<p><strong>What did you learn during Phase 1 of the Dance Talent Development Programme (DTDP)?</strong></p>
<p>I learnt a variety of dance such as Chinese, Malay and Indian dance, Contemporary dance and also Ballet during Phase 1 of the DTDP. I have never heard of contemporary dance before the programme and I had to learn the basics of it, which was not easy. I have learnt the different meanings behind different kinds of movements and also the art of integrating martial arts like silat into dance. It was a great experience learning about histories of different types of dance and execution of dance moves.</p>
<p><strong>What are some interesting experiences you gained from phase 1of the DTDP?</strong></p>
<p>Learning about different types of dance aside, what was also interesting for me was to dance with students from other schools with great talents. I was really afraid to dance when I saw how good they all were but I realised that each of us have strengths and weaknesses. That was how I started to just dance and not being afraid of what others think.</p>
<p>The most interesting dance that I learnt in DTDP was Ballet. I learnt about how Ballet started and how the dance changed over time. A lot of dance steps look similar to me initially, but now I know that the story behind each move is definitely different. I am starting to look at Ballet in a different light.</p>
<p><strong>How do you feel about getting selected for Phase 2 and 3?</strong></p>
<p>The moment I received the news from my teachers that I was one of the 6 students selected to go on to Phase 2 and 3 of DTDP, I was surprised. When I was at the audition, I did not expect anything more because I already had a great experience which was enough. I was really happy when I received the news, yet afraid of the unknown that is to come. Now I will have one more thing to manage besides studies, CCA and student Council.</p>
<p>I talked to my friends, my mum and also my teacher, Ms Uchida for advice. I finally made my decision to not miss this chance and go for it! I am confident that I can balance my time as I strive for my passion! I believe in myself and I will do my best to make my school and family proud.</p>
