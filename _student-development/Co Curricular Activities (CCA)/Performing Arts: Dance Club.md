<p>The NBSS Dance CCA, also known as Base Crew, is one of the few in Singapore
that explores a diverse range of dance genres, with Hip Hop and Indian
Dance as its two main branches. Every dancer in the CCA experiences both
styles over their four to five years in NBSS while also being exposed to
other genres such as multi-ethnic dance, lyrical and street jazz.</p>
<p>Our Dance Club aims to nurture passionate and versatile dancers by providing
them with opportunities to explore different dance forms. Through collaborations
with external agencies and community organisations, students gain valuable
exposure to the arts and deepen their appreciation of cultural diversity.</p>
<h3>What We Do</h3>

<p><strong>Workshops &amp; Learning Opportunities:</strong> Beyond technical

<h3>Student Testimonials</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>"Leading the NBSS Dance CCA has been a challenging yet incredibly fulfilling experience. Managing a team of over 60 dancers taught me that leadership goes beyond giving instructions. It's about listening, supporting others, and setting a positive and fun example. Through practices and performances across genres like Hip Hop, Indian Dance, and more, I’ve grown not just in dance, but in confidence, patience, and communication. I learnt how to manage different personalities, handle pressure, and keep the team motivated. This journey has deepened my appreciation for cultural diversity and the value of teamwork. Furthermore, dance is an experience that I would never regret doing despite the hardships and difficulties showing a sense of resilience and determination. Being a student leader has helped me become more resilient, responsible, and open-minded—skills I know I’ll carry with me beyond NBSS. " - Joash Lim, Sec 4</em></strong>
