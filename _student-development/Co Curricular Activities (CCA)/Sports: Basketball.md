<p>NBSS Basketball promotes the physical and socio-emotional development
of students through a holistic, values-based training approach. Using the
principles of basketball as a platform for character development, the programme
emphasises teamwork, sportsmanship, and integrity. Rigorous training further
instils discipline, perseverance, and a commitment to excellence.</p>
<p>Beyond the court, students are empowered to cultivate leadership skills
by taking ownership of team direction and management. They are also given
opportunities to plan, lead, and execute initiatives for their fellow CCA
members, developing confidence and responsibility in the process.</p>
