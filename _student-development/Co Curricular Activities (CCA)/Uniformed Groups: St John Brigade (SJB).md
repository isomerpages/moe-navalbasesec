<p>The St. John Brigade (SJB) CCA inspires cadets to engage in humanitarian
and charitable endeavours in service to society. Our cadets undergo rigorous
training in lifesaving skills, equipping them with the expertise and resilience
to respond effectively to emergencies and make meaningful contributions
to the community.</p>

</p>
<p>In Naval Base Secondary School, all SJB cadets gain the experience of
mentoring their juniors for a year, teaching life skills such as first
aid and home nursing. In addition, they are given the opportunity to organise
weekly training sessions. Cadet leaders also have multiple opportunities
to plan and execute other activities. Through the planning and execution
of these events, they learn to work as a team and understand the importance
of effective communication.</p>
