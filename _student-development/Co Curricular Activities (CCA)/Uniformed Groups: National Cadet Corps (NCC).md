<h4>Student Testimonials</h4>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I’m glad the NCC camp went better than expected. Most cadets were cooperative, and the Gel Blaster activity was a hit. I learned to be more responsible, adaptable, and team-oriented. Applying my SSLC training reinforced the importance of planning, while understanding the strengths of junior and senior cadets helped me support them better.”</em>

<p><em>“Participating in the FSD competition was a valuable first-time experience. The FSD Basic Instructor course provided a strong foundation, and the competition allowed me to apply my skills—planning routines, selecting music, and teaching my team. It strengthened my leadership, teamwork, and resilience as we worked through challenges to improve our performance.”</em>
