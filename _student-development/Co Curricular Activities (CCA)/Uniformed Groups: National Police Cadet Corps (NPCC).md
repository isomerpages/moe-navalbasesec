<p>Being a uniformed group, NPCC aims to develop our cadets into disciplined, resilient and responsible citizens who contribute actively to the greater community. To achieve this, our teachers work with the Singapore Police Force and NPCC Headquarters to plan engaging programmes which develop cadets into leaders of character.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Naval Base Secondary School, all NPCC cadets have the experience of mentoring their juniors for a year, teaching skills like camp-craft and inculcating like resilience. To further develop their leadership qualities, cadets challenge themselves in various camps throughout the years, in and out of school, working with people beyond the unit. Cadets are also given opportunities to participate in National Day parades and competitions such as the 0.22 Revolver Shoot, camp-craft and Drill competition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To develop concern for the community and environment, our cadets participate in VIA activities such as coastal clean-ups and flag day with cadets from other uniformed groups. As student ambassadors of the police force, our cadets also plan their own activities to spread crime prevention knowledge to the school and community.</p>
<p>Through these activities, our cadets understand that NPCC is not just about camp-craft and drills. It is about becoming confident and disciplined leaders who can work well with others, persevere in adversity and contribute to the community.</p>
