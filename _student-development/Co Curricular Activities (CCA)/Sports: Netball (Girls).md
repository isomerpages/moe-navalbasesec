<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>Netball is a sport that requires stamina, skill, teamwork, and quick decision-making.
At Naval Base Secondary School, we believe that sports is an excellent
way to build character, and we emphasise the importance of the journey
rather than just the outcome. Our teachers and coach work closely with
players to identify their strengths and areas for improvement, adjusting
the training programme to meet the specific needs of the team.</p>
<h4>What We Do</h4>
<p><strong>Training: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday, from 3:00 PM to
5:30 PM</p>
<p>Our players are not only exposed to various game positions but are also
encouraged to lead by example and mentor their juniors. They are motivated
to continuously reflect on their performances and identify areas for improvement.
Each year, Netball players have numerous opportunities to hone their skills
and represent the school in competitions, including the North Zone ‘B’
and ‘C’ Division Games, netball carnivals, and friendly matches.</p>

<p>From Secondary Two onwards, players are offered leadership opportunities
to guide their peers towards excellence and foster team cohesion. Secondary
Three players are further empowered to share their passion and expertise
by planning and hosting an intra-school Street Netball Tournament.</p>

<p>Through these activities, our players not only develop and showcase their
skills and teamwork but also condition themselves for greater challenges.
They come to understand that Netball is not solely about winning; it’s
about building resilience and maintaining a positive attitude while upholding
high standards in all their endeavours.</p>
