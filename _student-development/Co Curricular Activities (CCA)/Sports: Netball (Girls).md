<p>Netball is a game that requires stamina, skills, teamwork and prompt decision making skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Naval Base Secondary School, we believe that character can be built through sports and focus on the journey over the outcome. Hence, our teachers and coach work closely with our players to identify their strengths, areas for improvement and adjust the training programme accordingly to the needs of the players.</p>
<p>In addition to being exposed to playing a variety of game positions, our players are encouraged to train and lead their juniors by example. They are encouraged to continuously reflect on their performances and areas for improvements. Each year, Netball players are presented with opportunities to hone their skills and represent the school in annual competitions such as North Zone ‘B’ and ‘C’ division Games, Pesta Sukan Netball Carnivals and friendly games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the school’s Sports Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP) initiative in 2018, the Secondary Three players were empowered to share their passion and expertise for the game by planning and hosting the school’s first in-house Street Netball Tournament. This includes a Street Netball Clinic that was conducted for the registered players.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through these activities, our players are able to develop and display their skills, teamwork and to condition themselves. Our players understand that Netball is not just all about winning. It is about developing resilience and a positive attitude towards upholding high standards in all that they do.</p>
