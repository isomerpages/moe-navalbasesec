<p><strong><em><u>With Pride We Play</u></em></strong>
</p>
<p>Our band lives by the motto <strong>"With Pride We Play,"</strong> reflecting
our commitment to excellence in music and performance. At Naval Base Secondary
School, we dedicate ourselves fully to rehearsals and performances, striving
to deliver confident and skillful musical presentations. Strong teamwork
is essential to our success, especially in a co-curricular activity (CCA)
with multiple sections and members.</p>
<p>More than just musicians, we are a family. While differences of opinion
may arise, we always work together to resolve them with respect and understanding.
Over the years, we have faced many challenges, but through teamwork, perseverance,
and adaptability, we have grown stronger. We believe that adopting a growth
mindset is key to overcoming obstacles and reaching new heights.</p>
<p>The band actively contributes to school events such as the <strong>Lunar New Year concert, National Day celebration.</strong> Beyond
the school, we have also been invited to perform at public events, broadening
our experience and exposure.</p>
<p>With passion and unity, we continue to strive for musical excellence and
look forward to more opportunities to share our music with the community.</p>
