<p>Football at Naval Base Secondary School is more than just a sport—it is
a journey of growth, discipline, and camaraderie. As one of our most dynamic
Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs), we welcome students of all skill levels
to be part of a passionate and competitive football family.</p>
<p><strong>Our Vision: Building Champions On and Off the Field</strong>
</p>
<p>At Naval Base Secondary School, football is more than just a game—it’s
a platform for building character, discipline, and leadership. Through
training and competition, students develop resilience, teamwork, and a
never-give-up spirit that prepares them for challenges both on and off
the field. Every player is encouraged to strive for excellence, support
one another, and play with passion and integrity.</p>
<p><strong>The Journey</strong>
</p>
<p>Over four to five years, students sharpen technical skills, enhance tactical
awareness, and build mental strength. They also grow as leaders by mentoring
juniors, leading peers, and contributing through Values-in-Action (VIA)
initiatives. From exciting friendlies to the National School Games, every
experience is a step towards becoming a confident, values-driven champion.</p>

<h4>Student Testimonials</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>"Football CCA has taught me the true meaning of perseverance and discipline.
Through every training session and match, I grew closer to my teammates
and became stronger both on and off the field. One of the most unforgettable
moments was when we became League 5 Champions — it showed me what we could
achieve when we gave our all. That victory wasn’t just a medal, but a memory
that drives me to keep pushing. I’m proud of how far we’ve come, and I’m
determined to achieve even more in the years ahead." – Surren, Sec 3 Danforth</p>
<p></p>
<p>"As the captain of the Football team, I’ve gained so much more than just
skills on the pitch — I’ve learned the importance of responsibility, respect,
and care. Football has shaped the way I view challenges, teamwork, and
leadership, and it’s an experience I’ll carry with me for life. Some of
my most cherished memories include representing the school in the National
School Games with my teammates and co-organising the NBSS World Cup with
my EXCO members. These moments not only brought us closer as a team, but
also reminded me of the joy and purpose that football brings." – Daniel,
Sec 4-8</p>
