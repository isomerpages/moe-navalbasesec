#### NBSS Service-Learning Club (SLC) 
The NBSS Service-Learning Club (SLC) aims to nurture socially responsible citizens, who contribute to community and are good stewards of the environment. 
Service Learning Club was established to provide its members with opportunities to make a difference to the community and our environment by engaging in a variety of activities, such as caring for the environment as well as touching the lives of the underprivileged and the needy. 
Through activities and programmes such as beach clean-up, community services for the disabled and spreading kindness in the school community and beyond, we hope our members will be more aware of real-life issues faced in Singapore as well as by fellow Singaporeans. Ultimately, we hope our members will make it their lifelong pursuit to continue to sow seeds of love and kindness.

Members will take part in the following activities in 2023:

•	Beach Clean Up

•	Visit to the Cheshire Home for the disabled

•	Singapore Kindness Movement (Friend of Singa Project)
