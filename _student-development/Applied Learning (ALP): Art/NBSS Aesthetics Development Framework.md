<p>The NBSS ALP in Art takes reference from the larger Aesthetics Development Framework, which informs all aesthetics development programmes in the school, namely art, music and the performing arts. The framework and its explanation are given below:</p>

<p>The table below provides an explanation for the different sections of the framework diagram (from inside out):</p>
<p><u>Guiding Frameworks (Inner circle)</u></p>
<p>The school&rsquo;s aesthetic development efforts are guided by its core values of&nbsp;<em>Excellence, Care, Courage, Integrity</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Teamwork</em>, the Pyramid of Success model for character development, as well as the teaching and learning and character development frameworks.</p>
<p><u>Learning Domains (Ring 1)</u></p>
<p>Students&rsquo; arts learning is framed by three learning domains:&nbsp;<em>Perceiving &amp; Interpreting</em>,&nbsp;<em>Creating &amp; Communicating</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Appreciating</em>. The three domains encapsulate the cognitive, affective and psychomotor dimensions of students&rsquo; engagement in the arts. (Bloom, Engelhart, Furst, Hill, &amp; Krathwohl, 1956 and Anderson, Krathwohl, Airasian, Cruikshan, Mayer, Pintrich, P.R., Raths, &amp; Wittrock, 2001). They operate in a dynamic and interconnected manner to develop the students&rsquo; aesthetic literacy and sense.<br /><br />Within each learning domain, learning outcomes&nbsp;for each subject/arts area have been developed.</p>
<p><u>Strategic Objectives &amp; Initiatives (Ring 2)</u></p>
<p>These are the broad strategies that we will adopt to achieve the outcomes. These will be translated to strategic initiatives (programmes/approaches/etc.) at the operational level. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide breadth &amp; depth of arts experience</li>
<li>Develop character &amp; self-confidence through their arts practice</li>
<li>Nurture invention &amp; creative expression</li>
<li>Instil arts appreciation &amp; aesthetic sense</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Student Outcomes (Outermost ring)</u></p>
<p>These are the broad outcomes that the school hopes to see in the students at the end of their 4-5 years of aesthetics learning in the school. Forming the acronym ACES, the four broad student outcomes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ardent advocates</li>
<li>Confident communicators</li>
<li>Empowered thinkers</li>
<li>Skilled practitioners</li>
</ul>
