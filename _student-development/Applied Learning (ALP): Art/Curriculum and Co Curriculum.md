<h4><strong>The Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Our Applied Learning Programme in Art offers comprehensive art education throughout students' 4 to 5 years in NBSS. The curriculum spans four broad art disciplines:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fine Art</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Digital Media</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Critical Study of Art</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The ALP in Art is delivered through two main channels: the formal curriculum
(GAP and EAP) and co-curriculum programmes (CCAs, enrichment activities,
and talent development opportunities)</p>
<p><strong>Formal Art Curriculum</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The formal curriculum comprises the General Art Programme (GAP) at lower
secondary and the Enhanced Art Programme (EAP) at upper secondary levels.
Students on the EAP will offer Art at G1, G2, or G3 levels.</p>
<p><strong>Enhanced Art Programme&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>The Enhanced Art Programme (EAP) is a Ministry of Education initiative
introduced in 2011 to provide greater opportunities for students with keen
disposition and capability in art to develop their talent. It is a two-year
programme that provides an enriched learning environment for Secondary
3 and 4 students who are inclined towards art.</p>

<p></p>
<h4><strong>The Co-curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>The art co-curriculum enriches students' learning through dedicated Co-Curricular
Activities (CCA), enrichment programmes, and talent development opportunities.</p>
<p>Through this structured approach, students experience a wide range of
art and design practices, developing both breadth and depth in their artistic
journey.</p>
<p>The school offers three art Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) under the umbrella
of the Art Club, namely:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Digital Creators;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sculpture Studio; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Art Talent Development Programme (ATDP).</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Art Enrichment Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>Throughout their 4-5 years at NBSS, students experience a thoughtfully
planned journey of art enrichment that extends beyond the classroom. Students
participate in art workshops, engaging learning journeys, and hands-on
activities that complement their regular art curriculum. These enrichment
opportunities are strategically scheduled across the academic year to provide
continuous exposure to different aspects of art and design. From museum
visits and art workshops by their peers to practical studio sessions, each
experience is designed to deepen students' understanding and appreciation
of art.</p>

<h4><strong>Art Events</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Celebrating Creative perspectives: Our Annual Art Exhibition</strong>
</p>
<p>Our school's art culture is highlighted through various events throughout
the year, with the Annual Art Exhibition being our key showcase. This exhibition
celebrates student artworks and achievements from across all levels.</p>
<p>The annual NBSS Art Exhibition was first held in 2002 to celebrate and
showcase our Navalites' talents in the visual arts to the larger school
community and the public. Every year, the exhibition features over 120
artworks created by past and current Navalites. These comprise artworks
by our EAP art students, members of the Art Talent Development Programme
(ATDP) and Art Club, as well as artworks created over the course of Art
lessons by Secondary 1 to 5 students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The exhibition was wholly curated by our own Navalites. It is an application
of the learning acquired from the Learn to Curate Programme, which the
school developed in partnership with the National Gallery Singapore in
2016.</p>
