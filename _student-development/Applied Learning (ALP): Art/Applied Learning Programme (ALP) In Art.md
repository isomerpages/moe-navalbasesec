<p>The NBSS ALP in Art is rooted in the belief of the transformative power
of art and its ability to expand studentsâ€™ perceptions of the world around
them and potential for self-discovery and expression. As students make
art, they do more than just create, but also engage in a range of complex
reasoning processes, such as comparing, organising, making decisions, investigating,
questioning and problem-solving. Through studying and engaging in art,
they come to understand that it connects many creative and mainstream industries
whose products permeate our everyday lives and contribute to the development
of a vibrant Singapore culture. As students make connections between what
they learn and what they experience in the real world, they learn to see
the relevance of art to their own lives and better appreciate its significance
in the social, cultural and economic fabric of contemporary society.</p>
