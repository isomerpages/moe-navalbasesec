<p><strong>Student Development @ NBSS</strong>
</p>
<p>At NBSS, we believe that every Navalite can become a Leader of Self and
Leader of Others. Our beliefs and approaches to developing our Navalities
are articulated in our Student Development Framework.</p>

<p>Our RECIPE values form the core of our philosophy of student development,
focusing on developing Navalites’ 21st Century Competencies, Social-Emotional
Competencies and growth mindset, while ensuring their cognitive, social,
psychological, and physical well-being. Student development is facilitated
through various key enablers and approaches, catering to students’ needs
and profiles through a 4E approach (Embrace, Enrich, Engage, Excel), fostering
a caring and enabling school culture, and through enacting a Student Development
curriculum centred on CCE, CCA, Student Leadership, and Guidance.</p>
