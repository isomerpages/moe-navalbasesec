<h2><strong><em>Leaders</em></strong> of Character, Learners for Tomorrow</h2>
<p>With 'Leaders' being the very first word of our School Vision, it is natural
for student leadership to be a key focus area of our school. Even as we
establish structures and programmes for our student leaders in various
capacities, we recognise that every Navalite has the potential to lead
-- be it themselves or their peers, and at widely-varying levels.</p>
<h4>Student Leadership Philosophy, Development Framework and Desired Outcomes</h4>
<p>The NBSS Student Leadership Programme philosophy is founded on the belief
that every student has the potential to become an effective leader in their
own right, and is someone who can make a positive impact in their communities.
The programme is designed to develop students' leadership skills based
on the Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership as developed by James Kouzes
and Barry Posner.

<p>Backed by over 25 years of research and data of over three million leaders,
the Five Practices are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Model the Way: Leaders establish standards of excellence and set an example
for others to follow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inspire a Shared Vision: Leaders envision the future and inspire others
to work towards that vision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Challenge the Process: Leaders are willing to take risks and innovate,
and they encourage others to do the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable Others to Act: Leaders foster collaboration and build trust, empowering
others to take ownership of their work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage the Heart: Leaders recognize and celebrate the contributions
of others, creating a positive and supportive environment.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The NBSS Student Leadership Framework outlines the school’s approach to
nurturing student to become leaders of character, which encompasses not
only a Leader of Self but also a Leader of Others, to positively impact
those around them. It is rooted in our school’s core RECIPE values and
is enabled by equipping students with the essential skillsets - the Five
Practices of Exemplary Leadership.</p>
<p>Within this framework, a three tiered approach of Embrace, Enrich and
Excel, is taken to develop students in the 3 domains of leadership: self,
team, and community leadership.</p>
