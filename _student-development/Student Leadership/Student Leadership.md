#### Student Leadership Philosophy, Development Framework and Desired Outcomes

The NBSS Student Leadership Programme philosophy is founded on the belief that every student has the potential to become an effective leader in their own right, and is someone who can make a positive impact in their communities. The programme is designed to develop students' leadership skills based on the Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership as developed by James Kouzes and Barry Posner.

Backed by over 25 years of research and data of over three million leaders,  the Five Practices are:
* Model the Way: Leaders establish standards of excellence and set an example for others to follow.
* Inspire a Shared Vision: Leaders envision the future and inspire others to work towards that vision.
* Challenge the Process: Leaders are willing to take risks and innovate, and they encourage others to do the same.
* Enable Others to Act: Leaders foster collaboration and build trust, empowering others to take ownership of their work.
* Encourage the Heart: Leaders recognize and celebrate the contributions of others, creating a positive and supportive environment.
