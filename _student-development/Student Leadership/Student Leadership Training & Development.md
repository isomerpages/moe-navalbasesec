<p>At Naval Base, we provide our students with leadership training opportunities
that prepare them for the challenges of the future. To this end, we offer
a range of training programmes that focus on the five practices of exemplary
leadership: Model the Way, Inspire a Shared Vision, Challenge the Process,
Enable Others to Act, and Encourage the Heart.</p>
<p>All Secondary 2 students are equipped with the required skills and knowledge
of the practices through experiential learning during the Secondary 2 Student
Leadership modules. In addition to the broad-based training, role-specific
training for class committee members, CCA leaders, and councillors in their
respective boards are also conducted. These trainings are designed to help
students develop the skills they need to excel in their leadership roles.
Examples include role familiarisation and conflict resolution skills for
Class Leaders, while CCA leaders receive training in communication and
team dynamics during the annual leadership camp.

<p>Councillors in their respective boards also receive training that is tailored
to their specific responsibilities, such as advocating for environmental
issues in the Eco Board or organizing peer mentoring programs in the Peer
Support Board. Through these role-specific trainings, students are able
to develop their leadership skills in a targeted and meaningful way, while
also gaining valuable experience that prepares them for their leadership
roles.</p>
<p>Student councillors are given comprehensive training that focus on a range
of competencies. These include trainings for project management, team dynamics
and communication, which help student councillors to plan and execute events
and initiatives effectively. The trainings also encourage councillors to
think creatively and critically about existing systems and structures,
and to identify opportunities for improvement.</p>
