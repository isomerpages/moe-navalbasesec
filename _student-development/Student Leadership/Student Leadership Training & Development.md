### Developing Future Leaders

![](/images/stltnd2.png)

At Naval Base, we provide our students with leadership training opportunities that prepare them for the challenges of the future. To this end, we offer a range of training programmes that focus on the five practices of exemplary leadership: Model the Way, Inspire a Shared Vision, Challenge the Process, Enable Others to Act, and Encourage the Heart. 

All Secondary 2 students are equipped with the required skills and knowledge of the practices through experiential learning during the Secondary 2 Student Leadership modules. In addition to the broad-based training, role-specific training for class committee members, CCA leaders, and councillors in their respective boards are also conducted. These trainings are designed to help students develop the skills they need to excel in their leadership roles. Examples include role familiarisation and conflict resolution skills for Class Leaders, while CCA leaders receive training in communication and team dynamics during the annual leadership camp.

Councillors in their respective boards also receive training that is tailored to their specific responsibilities, such as advocating for environmental issues in the Eco Board or organizing peer mentoring programs in the Peer Support Board. Through these role-specific trainings, students are able to develop their leadership skills in a targeted and meaningful way, while also gaining valuable experience that prepares them for their leadership roles.

Student councillors are given comprehensive training that focus on a range of competencies. These include trainings for project management, team dynamics and communication, which help student councillors to plan and execute events and initiatives effectively. The trainings also encourage councillors to think creatively and critically about existing systems and structures, and to identify opportunities for improvement.
