<h3>Leading through Service</h3>
<p>Through a wide range of leadership opportunities in class, CCA and the
Student Council, students are able to put their skills and knowledge into
practice.</p>
<p>Student councillors play a vital role in representing the student body
and working with school administrators to improve the school community.
CCA leaders are responsible for overseeing the activities and development
of their respective CCAs, while class leaders serve as role models and
facilitators of positive class culture.

<p>These leadership roles provide students with the chance to develop their
communication, collaboration, and problem-solving skills, while also gaining
valuable experience in project management, event planning, and community
outreach. By taking on these roles, students develop the confidence, self-awareness,
and leadership skills necessary to make a positive impact in their communities
and beyond.</p>

<p>At NBSS, our student councillors play an important role in representing
the student body and the student voice. In line with the key programmes
and focus areas in NBSS, the student councillors are allocated into five
boards, allowing them to focus on a particular area of interest:</p>
<h5>Citizenship Education (CE) Board</h5>
<p>The CE Board is responsible for promoting active citizenship and organizing
activities that develop Navalites into civic-minded and informed citizens
of local and global issues. Some key events include the National Education
Commemorative Days consisting of Total Defence Day, Racial Harmony Day,
International Friendship Day and National Day.</p>
<h5>Peer Support Board</h5>
<p>The Peer Support Board focuses on creating a caring and inclusive school
culture, and actively promotes the use of different strategies to support
peers who may be struggling emotionally or socially. The key events of
the Peer Support Board include the NBSS Care Week and Navalites Unplugged.</p>
<h5>Eco Board</h5>
<p>The Eco board aims to raise awareness about environmental issues and promote
sustainable practices within the school community. Their key events include
World Water Day, Earth Day and the Biodiversity Week.</p>
<h5>Sports &amp; Wellness Board</h5>
<p>The Sports &amp; Wellness Board is responsible for promoting physical
fitness and the importance of healthy lifestyles among students. Some key
events include the annual Road Run and Sports Carnival.</p>
<h5>Aesthetics Board</h5>
<p>The Aesthetics Board advocates for and promote appreciation of the arts
among fellow Navalites. The board’s key events include the NBSS Arts Exhibition,
Arts Enrichment Week and Navalites’ Got Talent. Through the different boards,
student councillors are provided with opportunities to develop their leadership
skills in areas that align with their interests and leverage on their strengths.</p>
<h5><strong>As One Student Council</strong></h5>
<p>As a council, student councillors work collaboratively to organize a range
of school events and activities, including the annual Teachers' Day celebration,
where they bring the CCA Leaders and Class Leaders together to show appreciation
for the hard work and dedication of our teachers.</p>

well-organized, engaging, and inclusive for all Navalites. They work closely
with their CCA teachers to plan and execute events, and are also responsible
for mentoring and training younger members of their CCA, helping to create
a culture of camaraderie and excellence.
