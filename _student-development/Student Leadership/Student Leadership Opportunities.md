### Leading through Service

Through a wide range of leadership opportunities in class, CCA and the Student Council, students are able to put their skills and knowledge into practice. 

Student councillors play a vital role in representing the student body and working with school administrators to improve the school community. CCA leaders are responsible for overseeing the activities and development of their respective CCAs, while class leaders serve as role models and facilitators of positive class culture.

These leadership roles provide students with the chance to develop their communication, collaboration, and problem-solving skills, while also gaining valuable experience in project management, event planning, and community outreach. By taking on these roles, students develop the confidence, self-awareness, and leadership skills necessary to make a positive impact in their communities and beyond.

At NBSS, our student councillors play an important role in representing the student body and the student voice. In line with the key programmes and focus areas in NBSS, the student councillors are allocated into five boards, allowing them to focus on a particular area of interest:

##### Citizenship Education (CE) Board

The CE Board is responsible for promoting active citizenship and organizing activities that develop Navalites into civic-minded and informed citizens of local and global issues. Some key events include the National Education Commemorative Days consisting of Total Defence Day, Racial Harmony Day, International Friendship Day and National Day.

##### Peer Support Board
The Peer Support Board focuses on creating a caring and inclusive school culture, and actively promotes the use of different strategies to support peers who may be struggling emotionally or socially. The key events of the Peer Support Board include the NBSS Care Week and Navalites Unplugged. 

##### Eco Board
The Eco board aims to raise awareness about environmental issues and promote sustainable practices within the school community. Their key events include World Water Day, Earth Day and the Biodiversity Week.

##### Sports & Wellness Board
The Sports & Wellness Board is responsible for promoting physical fitness and the importance of healthy lifestyles among students. Some key events include the annual Road Run and Sports Carnival.

##### Aesthetics Board 
The Aesthetics Board advocates for and promote appreciation of the arts among fellow Navalites. The board’s key events include the NBSS Arts Exhibition, Arts Enrichment Week and Navalites’ Got Talent.
Through the different boards, student councillors are provided with opportunities to develop their leadership skills in areas that align with their interests and leverage on their strengths.

##### **As One Student Council**
As a council, student councillors work collaboratively to organize a range of school events and activities, including the annual Teachers' Day celebration, where they bring the CCA Leaders and Class Leaders together to show appreciation for the hard work and dedication of our teachers.

#### **CCA Leaders**
Our CCA leaders play a vital role in ensuring that CCA activities are well-organized, engaging, and inclusive for all Navalites. They work closely with their CCA teachers to plan and execute events, and are also responsible for mentoring and training younger members of their CCA, helping to create a culture of camaraderie and excellence.

#### **Class Leaders**
Our Class Chairpersons and Vice-chairpersons, along with the class committee members play an important role in fostering a positive and inclusive class culture. They serve as role models for their peers, helping to create a supportive and collaborative learning environment. Class Leaders are responsible for leading class discussions and coordinating class activities. By taking on these leadership roles, our Class Leaders develop valuable skills in communication, problem-solving, and interpersonal relationships, while also building strong connections with their peers.
