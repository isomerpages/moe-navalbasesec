Through a wide range of leadership opportunities in class, CCA and the Student Council, students are able to put their skills and knowledge into practice. 

Student councillors play a vital role in representing the student body and working with school administrators to improve the school community. CCA leaders are responsible for overseeing the activities and development of their respective CCAs, while class leaders serve as role models and facilitators of positive class culture. 

These leadership roles provide students with the chance to develop their communication, collaboration, and problem-solving skills, while also gaining valuable experience in project management, event planning, and community outreach. By taking on these roles, students develop the confidence, self-awareness, and leadership skills necessary to make a positive impact in their communities and beyond.
