<p><strong><u>Well-being starts with ourselves!</u></strong>
<br>At NBSS, we believe student well-being starts with cultivating a growth
mindset. Our Growth Mindset curriculum encourages Navalites to see challenges
as opportunities for growth. Guided by Form Teachers, they learn the value
of effort, planning, and resilience in times of stress.</p>

<p><strong><u>Peer Support Leaders (PSLs)</u></strong>
<br>Beyond personal development, we also foster well-being through building
a strong peer support network. We select and develop Peer Support Leaders
(PSLs) to promote positive mindsets, social-emotional support, and pro-social
behaviours to the school community.</p>

<p><strong><u>Navalites’ Unplugged</u></strong>
<br>One of our signature programmes to foster student well-being is Navalites
Unplugged, where PSLs work with other student leadership boards to encourage
peers to put away their mobile devices, be fully present with their friend,
and reconnect with the joy of face-to-face interaction.</p>
