<p>I had the fortune to have a very pleasant encounter with 3 NBSS students who did their school proud with their exemplary behaviour. I was having problems navigating the self-service machine when they enthusiastically helped me. Not only were they helpful, they were very courteous. They are good ambassadors of the school. I believe that affirmation from the school would encourage these girls to continue to be kind and helpful to the less IT- savvy older generation.</p>
