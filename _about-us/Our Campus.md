<h3>Welcome to Our Home!</h3>
<p>Our campus provides a welcoming and safe learning and working environment
for both students and staff. It is designed around 3 key concepts of (1)
School as a Big Learning Space (2) School in a Garden and (3) School as
a Giant Art Gallery.</p>

<h5>(1) A School as a Big Learning Space</h5>
<p>As Navalites move around in school, they have multiple opportunities to
interact with one another and learn from learning spaces outside of their
classrooms, from the Horizon – our school library, to our hydroponics and
aquaponics stations and therapeutic garden.</p>
<h5>(2) A School in a Garden</h5>
<p>Through our landscaping and environmental efforts, we have created a variety
of green spaces around school, from our sprawling artificially turfed Plaza,
to Starboard, a sheltered outdoor self-study and activity area. Navalities
relish being in the airy outdoor spaces and enjoy social activities or
self-study during their recess and lunch breaks, and after school.</p>
<h5>(3) A School as a Giant Art Gallery</h5>
<p>The school acts as a large art gallery displaying artworks created by
students, staff, parents and other stakeholders. There are artworks on
the walls along the corridors, staircases, indoors and outdoors, and on
every floor of the school building. The artworks range from individual
creations to larger collective installations. The increasingly rich repertoire
of artistic expressions, styles, forms and themes provide a stimulating
environment for creative expression, conversation and learning.</p>
