<h3>Welcome to Our Home!</h3>
<p></p>
<p>NBSS aims to be a caring school for our community to live, work and play
in, where the human character flourishes.</p>
<p>The school's Khatib campus is designed around the following three concepts,
which seek to make the school a welcoming and safe home for both staff
and students, as well as an inviting space for partners and visitors for
collaboration and learning.</p>
<h5>(1) A School as a Big Learning Space</h5>
<p>As Navalites move around school daily, they have multiple opportunities
to learn and find out more about the world. From staircases decorated with
decals of mathematical formulae, to garden plots with food crops, Navalites
are able to learn more about life and the world just by moving around school.</p>
<h5>(2) A School in a Garden</h5>
<p>Visitors to NBSS are often struck by the amount of green they see, and
marvel at the meticulously-manicured landscaping. We are particularly proud
of the variety of green spaces scattered around the school, from our sprawling
artificially-turfed Plaza, to the ever-popular Starboard tables. Navalites
relish being in the airy outdoor spaces and embrace them as much as Singapore
has embraced its reputation as a Garden City.</p>
<h5>(3) A School as a Giant Art Gallery</h5>
<p>The entire school campus has been converted to a large art gallery displaying
artworks created by students, staff, parents and other stakeholders. There
are artworks on the walls, floors and ceilings, in waterscapes and landscapes,
indoors as well as outdoors and on every floor of the school building.
The artworks range from individual creations to large-scale collective
installations. The increasingly rich repertoire of artistic expressions,
styles, forms and themes provide a stimulating environment for cross-fertilisation
of ideas and for team learning and growth.</p>

<p>The artworks are displayed according to a larger curatorial concept. Each
floor of the school building focuses on a specific ecological stratum that
represents an aspect of nature or life.</p>
