<p>NBSS aims to be a caring school for our community to live, work and play in, where the human character flourishes. The twin concepts of &lsquo;School as a Giant Art Gallery&rsquo; and &lsquo;School in a Garden&rsquo; contribute to the overarching concept of the &lsquo;School as a Big Learning Space&rsquo;, which fulfils this vision, so that the school remains a welcoming and safe home for both staff and students, as well as an inviting space for partners and visitors for collaboration and learning.</p>

# Our School as a Giant Art Gallery
<p>The entire school campus has been converted to a large art gallery displaying artworks created by students, staff, parents and other stakeholders. There are artworks on the walls, floors and ceilings, in waterscapes and landscapes, indoors as well as outdoors and on every floor of the school building. The artworks range from individual creations to large-scale collective installations. The increasingly rich repertoire of artistic expressions, styles, forms and themes provide a stimulating environment for cross-fertilisation of ideas and for team learning and growth.</p>

<p>Level 2 Exhibits depict close-range renditions of trees, flowers, animals and insects.</p>
<p>Level 3 Exhibits art depict bird-eye views of landscapes and nature.</p>
