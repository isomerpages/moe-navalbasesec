### A Special Partnership Unlike Any Other
With "Naval Base" being our school name, it would be unimaginable for us not to establish a strong friendship with our nation's Navy. We are proud to be given the opportunity to establish links with the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) in 1999. In an effort to instil pride in our roots and history, the names of the Missile Corvettes in the 8th Flotilla of the RSN - Victory, Valiant, Vigour, Valour and Vigilance were adopted. Today, these names grace the exterior facade of our school buildings, just as they currently grace the exterior facades of the naval craft they represent -- [check out our RSN partners here!]

Through frequent reminders of our links to the Navy, we hope that Navalites would understand, appreciate and internalise the values and attitudes encapsulated in the names and mottos of the Missile Corvettes, as well as the commitment to excellence that our Navy embodies, given Singapore's position as a maritime state.
	
The school's collaboration with the navy has continued to strengthen through the years. Today, our 8th Flotilla partners actively extend invitations to our Navalites and teachers to board its craft to experience first-hand their advanced capabilities, and we are privileged to be invited to many of their major events. 

In return, the school's gates are always open to our 8th Flotilla partners, who regularly grace our school functions. Most prominently, our 8th Flotilla partners grace our Student Leader Investiture as Special Invited Guests, and engage our student leaders in conversations about leadership in today's world.
