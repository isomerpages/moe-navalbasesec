<h3>A Special Partnership Unlike Any Other</h3>
<p>With a history spanning over six decades, Naval Base Secondary School
is proud to claim a distinct naval heritage. Founded in 1957 by the British
Navy as Naval Base School, our institution was originally established to
serve the children of the British Naval Base employees.</p>
<p>Through the years, we remain committed to nurturing strong relationships
with our nation's naval community, and we cherish the lasting partnership
we have established with the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) since 1999.
To honour our roots and history, we have adopted the names of the Missile
Corvettes in the 8th Flotilla of the RSN - Victory, Valour, Vigilance,
Valiant, Vigour and Vengeance. Today, the names of these naval craft grace
the exterior facade of our school buildings. <a href="https://www.mindef.gov.sg/home" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Find out more about our RSN partners here!</a>

<p>Through frequent reminders of our links to the Navy, we hope that Navalites
will understand, appreciate and internalise the values and attitudes encapsulated
in the names and mottos of the Missile Corvettes, as well as the commitment
to excellence that our Navy embodies, given Singapore's position as a maritime
state.</p>
<p>The school's collaboration with the navy has continued to strengthen through
the years. Today, our 8th Flotilla partners actively engage us in learning
journeys and we are privileged to perform at their major events. Annually,
our 8th Flotilla partners grace our Student Leader Investiture as Special
Invited Guests, and engage our student leaders in conversations about leadership
in today's world.</p>
