<h3>A Special Partnership Unlike Any Other</h3>
<p>With "Naval Base" being our school name, it would be unimaginable for
us not to establish a strong friendship with our nation's Navy. We are
proud to be given the opportunity to establish links with the Republic
of Singapore Navy (RSN) in 1999. In an effort to instil pride in our roots
and history, the names of the Missile Corvettes in the 8th Flotilla of
the RSN - Victory, Valiant, Vigour, Valour and Vigilance were adopted.
Today, these names grace the exterior facade of our school buildings, just
as they currently grace the exterior facades of the naval craft they represent

<p>Through frequent reminders of our links to the Navy, we hope that Navalites
would understand, appreciate and internalise the values and attitudes encapsulated
in the names and mottos of the Missile Corvettes, as well as the commitment
to excellence that our Navy embodies, given Singapore's position as a maritime
state.</p>
<p>The school's collaboration with the navy has continued to strengthen through
the years. Today, our 8th Flotilla partners actively extend invitations
to our Navalites and teachers to board its craft to experience first-hand
their advanced capabilities, and we are privileged to be invited to many
of their major events.</p>
<p>In return, the school's gates are always open to our 8th Flotilla partners,
who regularly grace our school functions. Most prominently, our 8th Flotilla
partners grace our Student Leader Investiture as Special Invited Guests,
and engage our student leaders in conversations about leadership in today's
world.</p>
