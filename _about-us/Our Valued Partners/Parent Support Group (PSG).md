**Parent Support Group (PSG)**

The NBSS Parent Support Group (PSG) was formed in 2023 with the aim of strengthening the home-school partnership for our Navalites to succeed. As the adage goes, ‘It takes a village to raise a child’. This alludes to the kampong spirit or gotong royong, where the whole community comes together to do their best to help one another in nurturing the child. Parents are crucial stakeholders to NBSS. Research has shown that children whose parents are involved in their educational journey have greater self-esteem, are more self-disciplined, show more positive attitudes and have higher aspirations and motivations towards school. 
The PSG complements the school by aligning its objectives with the school’s directions. The unified goal has been to come together as a community to provide the best educational experience for our Navalites. Our entire school community has been tremendously appreciative of our parents’ involvement in school programmes and events this year, as they have been a very vibrant addition to our school life. 
At NBSS, our PSG Executive Committee (Exco) comprises a group of enthusiastic and committed parents who go the extra mile to support the school programmes and activities to develop our Navalites holistically. By working hand in hand with the school, our PSG is involved in the school lives of our Navalites, thus helping them to reach their potential.
