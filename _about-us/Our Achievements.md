#### Navalites in our Community: Compliments from the Public

**August 2022**

I am writing in to you as I would like to commend one of your student, Alfiyah, from Class 3-5. ðŸ˜Š

I attended the National Day Parade two days back with my family. As we arrived earlier, we had to sit in the hot afternoon sun for about 1.5 hours. My 3.5yo toddler was getting increasingly grumpy as he was sweaty and heat rash appeared on his neck. I used the foldable fan to fan him and continuously used wet tissue to wipe his neck but he was still upset as the rashes was itchy and painful. Thereafter, I realised that Alfiyah, who was seated behind us, was actually helping to fan him too! I do not know how long she actually did so before I found out but thereafter, after thanking her and chatting with her family, she did that for easily 30-45 mins and I was very touched. In the hot sun, she was also sweating profusely but she chose to fan my son, a stranger, and not herself. It may be a small act of kindness but to me, that meant a lot. It was truly our Singapore spirit!

As educators, we enter the teaching fraternity with hopes of inspiring and moulding our future generation; I myself always teach my students about kindness and empathy too. Naval Base Secondary, under all of your guidance, has clearly done a wonderful job instilling such important values in your students and I cannot be prouder as a fellow educator. As a mother, I am grateful to Alfiyah for her kindess and empathy on National Day and it will be something I will remember for a long time to come. ðŸ˜Š

Do feel free to contact me if you require any more information and I hope this commendation will be passed on to Alfiyah as well as her teachers who have done a wonderful job teaching her class. 

**July 2022**

In collaboration with our partners from Yishun South Neighbourhood Police Centre, Land Transport Authority and SMRT, a digital artwork by Phoebe Lim Xinyu *(pictured below)* was produced for display across a few MRT pillars in the Khatib vicinity. The poster is intended to remind cyclists and pedestrians about road safety, and the importance of looking out for one another.

**February 2022**

I had the fortune to have a very pleasant encounter with 3 NBSS students *(pictured below)* who did their school proud with their exemplary behaviour. I was having problems navigating the self-service machine when they enthusiastically helped me. Not only were they helpful, they were very courteous. They are good ambassadors of the school. I believe that affirmation from the school would encourage these girls to continue to be kind and helpful to the less IT-savvy older generation.
