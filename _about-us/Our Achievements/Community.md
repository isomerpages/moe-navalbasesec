<h4>Awards and Commendation</h4>
<p><strong>Navalites in our Community: Compliments from the Public</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>August 2022</strong>
</p>
<p>I am writing in to you as I would like to commend one of your student,
Alfiyah, from Class 3-5. ðŸ˜Š
<br>I attended the National Day Parade two days back with my family. As we
arrived earlier, we had to sit in the hot afternoon sun for about 1.5 hours.
My 3.5yo toddler was getting increasingly grumpy as he was sweaty and heat
rash appeared on his neck. I used the foldable fan to fan him and continuously
used wet tissue to wipe his neck but he was still upset as the rashes was
itchy and painful. Thereafter, I realised that Alfiyah, who was seated
behind us, was actually helping to fan him too! I do not know how long
she actually did so before I found out but thereafter, after thanking her
and chatting with her family, she did that for easily 30-45 mins and I
was very touched. In the hot sun, she was also sweating profusely but she
chose to fan my son, a stranger, and not herself. It may be a small act
of kindness but to me, that meant a lot. It was truly our Singapore spirit!</p>
<p>As educators, we enter the teaching fraternity with hopes of inspiring
and moulding our future generation; I myself always teach my students about
kindness and empathy too. Naval Base Secondary, under all of your guidance,
has clearly done a wonderful job instilling such important values in your
students and I cannot be prouder as a fellow educator. As a mother, I am
grateful to Alfiyah for her kindess and empathy on National Day and it
will be something I will remember for a long time to come. ðŸ˜Š</p>
<p>Do feel free to contact me if you require any more information and I hope
this commendation will be passed on to Alfiyah as well as her teachers
who have done a wonderful job teaching her class.</p>
<p><strong>February 2022</strong>
</p>
<p>I had the fortune to have a very pleasant encounter with 3 NBSS students
(pictured below) who did their school proud with their exemplary behaviour.
I was having problems navigating the self-service machine when they enthusiastically
helped me. Not only were they helpful, they were very courteous. They are
good ambassadors of the school. I believe that affirmation from the school
would encourage these girls to continue to be kind and helpful to the less
IT-savvy older generation.</p>
