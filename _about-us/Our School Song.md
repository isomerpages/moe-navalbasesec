<p>We are proud to belong to Naval Base School<br />We shall always cherish its name<br />It shall warm our hearts though we be far away<br />And shall stir our blood until our dying days</p>
<p><strong>CHORUS:</strong><br />Hooray hooray hooray, let&rsquo;s yell<br />Three cheers for Naval Base School</p>
<p>Many a time in the past we were wrought with care<br />We had plunged to the depths of despair<br />Then the name of our school rang out loud and clear<br />And at once we rejoiced and lost our fear</p>
<p><strong>CHORUS:</strong><br />Hooray hooray hooray, let&rsquo;s yell<br />Three cheers for Naval Base School</p>
<p>Come what may to us in the days ahead<br />Be they filled with pleasure or pain<br />We&rsquo;ll not flinch one bit under stress or strain<br />But we&rsquo;ll face the future singing this refrain</p>
<p><strong>FINAL CHORUS:</strong><br />Stout hearts, brave deeds, great thoughts recall<br />Proud mem&rsquo;ries of Naval Base School</p>
<p><strong>MUSIC AND LYRICS BY MR R.W. MOSBERGEN</strong></p>
