<p>The entire school campus has been converted to a large art gallery displaying artworks created by students, staff, parents and other stakeholders. There are artworks on the walls, floors and ceilings, in waterscapes and landscapes, indoors as well as outdoors and on every floor of the school building. The artworks range from individual creations to large-scale collective installations. The increasingly rich repertoire of artistic expressions, styles, forms and themes provide a stimulating environment for cross-fertilisation of ideas and for team learning and growth.</p>
