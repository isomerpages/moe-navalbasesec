<p>The history of Naval Base Secondary School (NBSS) began in 1957 when the British Navy set aside a piece of land in the British Naval Base at Bah Tan Road to build a proper school for the children of the naval base employees. The school was then known as Naval Base School and was a full school. In 1968, the school was renamed Naval Base Secondary School when the primary section&nbsp;moved to Canberra School.</p>
<p>The school was relocated from its modest buildings at Bah Tan Road to its present premises in Yishun Ring Road in July 1988.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NBSS underwent PRIME upgrading and was temporarily housed at a holding site in Sembawang from 2008 to 2009. In December 2009, the school returned with great enthusiasm to its beautifully upgraded campus which was designed both as a &ldquo;&nbsp;School in a Garden&nbsp;&rdquo; and &ldquo;&nbsp;School as a Giant Art Gallery&nbsp;&rdquo; in-line with the emergence of visual art as a niche strength of the school.</p>
<p>Below is a summary of milestones in NBSS history</p>
