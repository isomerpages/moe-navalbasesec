<h4><strong>School Vision:<br /></strong><em>Leaders of Character, School of Excellence</em></h4>
<p>NBSS is a school that nurtures leaders &ndash; in the workplace, in the community and at home. The emphasis on leadership extends upon the previous vision to nurture leaders. We believe everyone can be a leader in their chosen fields and areas of influence. Some will be leaders of small teams while others will extend their influence on many.</p>
<p>Leaders of Character are about people who guide and inspire others through their actions as persons of character and role models to the people around them. A person of character has the wisdom to know right from wrong; is honest, trustworthy, respectful and responsible. Lickona (1991) suggests that character is a universal phenomenon descriptive of a person who possesses the courage and conviction to live by moral virtues and who exhibits strength in both performance and moral character. Performance character is explained as &ldquo;mastery oriented&rdquo; in nature; transcending beyond diligence. In NBSS, it entails the attainment of the 5 As, namely Attire, Attendance, Attention, Assignment and Attitude. Moral character is about &ldquo;relational orientation&rdquo; based on successful interpersonal relationships and ethical conduct. A Leader of Character does not just get toe the line; a Leader of Character seeks to achieve excellence in everything that he does.</p>
<p>A School of Excellence embraces excellence as a way of life; as its culture. Our motto Enitamur in altiora, or Be our best, requires the whole school to give our best and always take pride in everything that we do. Excellence, as a value and attribute, refers to the high standards we set for ourselves. The Pyramid of Success (PoS), containing fifteen essential qualities, serves as a guide for our journey to achieve success and excellence. A School of Excellence thrives on three main attitudes: innovation, enthusiasm for learning and desire to push the boundaries at all times. These will form our key approach when relooking at our school programmes and processes.</p>

<h4><strong>School Motto:</strong><br />Enitamur In Altiora</h4>
<p><em>Our school motto, Enitamur in altiora, inspires us to aim to achieve as high as we can, be our best and inspire others. The school motto has not been changed as it is very much a part of the school&rsquo;s DNA. It continues to be relevant and is aligned to the new vision, mission and core values.</em></p>
