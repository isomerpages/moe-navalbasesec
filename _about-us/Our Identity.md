<h3>Our Vision: Leaders of Character, Learners for Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Leaders of Character are individuals who guide and inspire others as persons
of character. As persons of character, Navalites internalise and demonstrate
our RECIPE (Respect, Resilience, Care, Integrity, Passion, Excellence)
values, integrating both moral and performance values holistically (Lickona,
2005). They then serve as role models, influencing others in various fields
through their thoughts and actions.</p>
<p>Learners for Tomorrow are future-ready learners who possess the knowledge,
skills and competencies to adapt and thrive in an uncertain and rapidly
changing environment of the 21st Century. They are lifelong learners who
continuously learn and adapt to stay relevant. They possess student agency
and take proactive steps to positively strengthen the learning of themselves
and others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Our vision thus articulates our goal to foster all rounded individuals
– strong in both character and learning so that they are not only morally
upright individuals, but also forward-looking learners well-equipped to
contribute to the community and nation.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Our Mission: To Nurture Future-Ready Learners With the Heart &amp; Will to Impact Others Positively</h3>
<p>Through our curriculum and programmes, we aim to equip Navalites with
learning so that they are prepared for the future as future-ready learners.
These include the knowledge, skills and competencies detailed in the MOE
Desired Outcomes of Education (Secondary) and the MOE 21CC framework, complemented
by external scans from WEF, OCED and Skillsfuture SG mapping of skills
for the future economy. Beyond these, we also integrate dispositions for
lifelong learning in our curriculum as the future-ready learner will have
to continuously learn and adapt to stay relevant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Our mission is not confined to learning, but also in terms of character
building – especially in the context of active citizenry. Taking reference
from the ‘head, heart, hand’ framework (NE, 2007), Navalites should also
internalise our school core values (RECIPE) and take active steps to contribute
to the betterment of their immediate family, community and nation as active
citizens.</p>
<h3>Our Motto: Enitamur In Altiora</h3>
<p>Our school motto, Enitamur in Altiora, inspires us to be our best, aim
for high standards and inspire others. The school motto is an integral
part of the school’s DNA.</p>
<h3>Our Core Values: RECIPE</h3>
<h5><strong>Re</strong>spect, <strong>Re</strong>silience, <strong>C</strong>are, <strong>I</strong>ntegrity, <strong>P</strong>assion, <strong>E</strong>xcellence</h5>
<p>While there are many good values that we want to inculcate in each Navalite,
we need to have a set of core beliefs that we hold dear to. These beliefs
are used as criteria to base our decisions upon and guide our actions and
behaviour among staff and students towards our stakeholders and the public
and we have identified the RECIPE for success.</p>

<h3>Our School Crest</h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/crest.gif">
</div>
<p>The <strong>lion</strong> embodies Singapore:To take pride in our national
identity, have a sense of belonging to Singapore and be committed to nation
building. The lion also symbolises bravery (strength in character) and
courage (strength of the mind).</p>
<p>The <strong>open book</strong> symbolises the importance of a good education
and in constant pursuit of knowledge to achieve success in life.</p>
<p>The <strong>four yellow lines</strong> represent the four ethnic groups
in Singapore; Chinese, Malays, Indians and Others, working and living together
in harmony.</p>
<p>The <strong>blue background</strong> shows our commitment to integrate new
citizens as we value Singapore’s socio-cultural diversity, promote social
cohesion and harmony.</p>
<p>The <strong>three rings</strong> are inspired by the Olympics. The three
rings represent excellence in both performance and moral character, which
translates to academic excellence and in the school’s distinct programmes;
such as the Sports and the Arts.</p>
<h3>Our School Song</h3>
<p>In 1965, then-Principal Mr Mosbergen was inspired to compose the <a href="https://www.navalbasesec.moe.edu.sg/other/school-song/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">lyrics and music of the school song</a> when
he saw how the school did not have a song or cheer to celebrate their championship
in three out of four divisions in a cross-country race. The school song
is still being sung by Navalites today and a copy is safekept at the MOE
Heritage Centre.</p>
