<p>Naval Base Secondary School is a school of rich heritage for 65 years. From our humble beginnings as a school for Naval Base employees in 1957, we have evolved and developed through the years to be a learning community for students from different races and nationalities. I feel privileged and excited to be entrusted with leading NBSS, and to build on the excellent foundation and success of my predecessor Mr Sulaiman.</p>
<p>Our motto, Enitamur In Altiora, is to be our best and to inspire others. We hold the unwavering conviction that every child is both a learner and a leader. Our emphasis is to develop each student to succeed in their learning and leadership, so that they do not achieve success only for themselves, but also for the benefit of others in their school and society. Everyone will be a leader in some way at some point in life, be it in the family, in the workplace or in one's social circles. Hence, our school places strong emphasis on character and leadership development, and encourages all students to seize the many opportunities provided for them.</p>
<p>Our young adults face numerous destabilizing challenges and uncertainties in their lives and in their future. But our goal is not for our students merely to survive and cope with difficulties. Our goal is to build students of substance and resilience to thrive and help others. NBSS has a bespoke character development program, SHIPSHAPE, that develops orderliness, focus, and commitment in all our students. We strive to inculcate core values that will strengthen their character, develop a growth mindset, do good to others, and seize the right opportunities to make positive contributions to their community and the world.</p>
<p>Likewise, the professional development of our teachers is vitally important. As a school leader with a background as a school staff developer, I take a keen interest in the professional development of my colleagues. Teachers should not run on empty, and hence we invest in robust professional development of all our teachers so that they can continually develop in their teaching, and be exemplary learners for their students.</p>
<p>2022 will bring new possibilities and experiences. I am committed to journey with each and everyone in the Naval Base family to nurture every Navalite to realize his/her potential. I believe that with resilient learning and steadfast solidarity, we can all work together to become our best version of ourselves, and live out our school motto &ndash; Enitamur In Altiora.</p>
