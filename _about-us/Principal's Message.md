<p>Naval Base Secondary School has a proud heritage spanning 68 years. From
our humble beginnings in 1957 as a school for Naval Base employees, we
have grown into a vibrant learning community.</p>
<p>Our school motto, <em>Enitamur In Altiora</em>—"<em>Be Our Best</em>"—guides
everything we do. We firmly believe that every child is both a learner
and a leader. Our goal is not only to help students achieve success but
also to inspire them to use their abilities to uplift others. Leadership
is not confined to titles; it manifests in everyday actions—within families,
workplaces, and communities. This is why we place a strong emphasis on
character and leadership development, encouraging every student to embrace
the opportunities provided for them.</p>
<p>In an ever-changing world filled with challenges and uncertainties, our
aim is not just to help our students navigate difficulties but to empower
them to thrive. Through our school values—<strong>R</strong>espect, <strong>RE</strong>silience, <strong>C</strong>are, <strong>I</strong>ntegrity, <strong>P</strong>assion,
and <strong>E</strong>xcellence (RECIPE for success)—we nurture students
of character who embrace a growth mindset, contribute meaningfully to society,
and create positive change in their communities and beyond.</p>
<p>Likewise, the professional development of our teachers is vitally important.
As a school leader with a background in staff development, I deeply believe
that educators should never "run on empty." That is why we invest in their
growth, ensuring they continually refine their craft and remain exemplary
learners for their students.</p>
<p>As we step into 2025, new possibilities and experiences await. I am committed
to journeying alongside every member of the Naval Base family, guiding
our students to realize their full potential. Together, through resilient
learning and steadfast solidarity, we will become the best versions of
ourselves and live out our school motto—<em>Enitamur In Altiora.</em>
