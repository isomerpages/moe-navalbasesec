<p>    
Naval Base Secondary School is a school of rich heritage for 66 years. From our humble beginnings as a school for Naval Base employees in 1957, we have evolved and developed through the years to be a learning community for students from different races and nationalities.</p>

        
Our young adults face numerous destabilizing challenges and uncertainties in their lives and in their future. But our goal is not for our students merely to survive and cope with difficulties. Our goal is to build students of substance and resilience to thrive and help others.  We strive to inculcate our school values, _Excellence, Care, Courage, Integrity, and Teamwork,_ that will strengthen their character, develop a growth mindset, do good to others, and seize the right opportunities to make positive contributions to their community and the world.

Likewise, the professional development of our teachers is vitally important. As a school leader with a background as a school staff developer, I take a keen interest in the professional development of my colleagues. Teachers should not run on empty, and hence we invest in robust professional development of all our teachers so that they can continually develop in their teaching, and be exemplary learners for their students.

2023 will bring new possibilities and experiences. I am committed to journey with each and everyone in the Naval Base family to nurture every Navalite to realize his/her potential. I believe that with resilient learning and steadfast solidarity, we can all work together to become our best version of ourselves, and live out our school motto – Enitamur In Altiora.
