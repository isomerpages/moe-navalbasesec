<p>Naval Base Secondary School was proud to be given the opportunity to establish links with the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) in 1999. In an effort to instil pride in our roots and history, the names of the Missile Corvettes in the 8th Flotilla of the RSN - Victory, Valiant, Vigour, Valour and Vigilance were adopted. 
	
Through frequent reminders of our links to the Navy, we hope that Navalites would understand, appreciate and internalise the values and attitudes encapsulated in the names and mottos of the Missile Corvettes. 
	
The school's collaboration with the navy has continued to strengthen through the years. As one of our partners, senior commanders of the 8th Flotilla are regularly invited to school functions, and the RSN conducts career talks and scheduled visits for our students to the Naval Bases.
